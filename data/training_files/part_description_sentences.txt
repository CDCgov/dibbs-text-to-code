Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBCs).
Measures of reticulocyte maturity can provide complementary information to absolute reticulocyte counts for assessing erythropoietic activity.
As reticulocytes mature, they progressively accumulate hemoglobin and lose RNA, so maturity can be measured based on the reticulocyte RNA content.
Automated analyzers can use this property to subclassify reticulocytes into different maturity groups by tagging the intracellular RNA and then measuring the light scatter (fluorescence) of the tagged cells, which is proportional to the RNA content.
RBCs have the least scatter, followed by the most mature reticulocytes, mid-level, and least mature, which have the highest scatter.
The immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is defined as the proportion of mid- and high-scatter reticulocytes out of the total.
A rise in IRF is one of the earliest indicators of bone marrow engraftment or recovery from intensive chemotherapy.
The IRF can also be used as an early indicator of response to erythropoietin therapy in patients with chronic renal failure and to treatment for anemia.
O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is an essential enzyme involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents.
Hypermethylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA damage and prone to tumor development.
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation.
In patients with malignant brain tumors, the loss of activity has been shown to be a promising predictor of response to alkylating agent-based chemotherapies, including BCNU (carmustine), CCNU and Temozolomide.
The loss of MGMT activity in tumor cells can no longer repair the methyl adduct formation caused by the chemotherapy, leading to lethal cross-links between DNA strands.
Most patients with methylated MGMT (m_MGMT) experience an increase in overall survival and time to progression of the disease.

Leptospira is a flexible, spiral-shaped, Gram-negative spirochete with internal flagella.
Leptospira interrogans has many serovars based on cell surface antigens.
Most leptospirosis infections initially present with an acute onset of fever, headache and muscle pain, which symptoms last about a week.
The three organ systems most frequently involved with more significant illness are the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver, and jaundice occurs with severe infections.
With the appearance of antileptospiral antibodies, the acute phase of the disease subsides and leptospires can no longer be isolated from the blood.
The disease is usually biphasic, with the acute phase followed by an immune phase, which occurs after an asymptomatic period of several days.
The immune phase is associated with fever and central nervous system involvement, specifically meningitis.
Leptospires appear in the urine during this phase and are shed for various periods depending on the host.
Severe leptospirosis is associated with progressive impairment of hepatic and renal function, and renal failure is the most common cause of death.
Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis with a variety of animal hosts.
The primary reservoir is wild animals such as rodents, which can shed leptospires throughout their lifetimes.
Domestic animals are also an important source of human infections.
The disease is more widespread in tropical countries.
Direct or indirect contact with urine containing virulent leptospires is the major means by which leptospirosis is transmitted.
Leptospira species, which include L. interrogans, L. autumnalis, L. borgpetersenii, and L. weili are further divided into more than 200 serotypes based on their antigenic composition.
The more severe form of leptospirosis is frequently associated with the icterohaemorrhagiae serotype and is often referred to as Weil's disease.

In patients with systemic sclerosis, anti-SCL-70 may be associated with more severe disease, and in patients with SLE, anti-SCL-70 suggests an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension and renal involvement.
In general, anti-SCL-70 antibody status may help with diagnosis, treatment planning and prognosis in patients with connective tissue disease.
Androstenedione (also known as 4-androstenedione) is a 19-carbon steroid hormone produced in the adrenal glands and the gonads as an intermediate step in the biochemical pathway that produces the androgen testosterone and the estrogens estrone and estradiol.
It is the common precursor of male and female sex hormones.
Some androstenedione is also secreted into the plasma, and may be converted in peripheral tissues to testosterone and estrogens.
Androstenedione originates either from the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone or from 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
It is further converted to either testosterone or estrone.
The production of adrenal androstenedione is governed by ACTH, while production of gonadal androstenedione is controled by gonadotropins.

In most patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a pathogenic FECH mutation that reduces enzyme activity by 50% can be identified on only 1 allele.
Clinical expression of EPP typically requires a hypomorphic (low expression) FECH allele (IVS3-48T->C) in trans (on a different chromosome) with the mutation.
IVS3-48T->C is a variant of the FECH gene associated with reduced gene expression.
This variant is found in approximately 10% of the general Caucasian population.

It is a positive regulator of apoptosis, and also has been shown to limit the proliferative potential of autoreactive CD8 effector T cells and protect the body against autoimmunity.
Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.
CD30 is associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
It is expressed in embryonal carcinoma but not in seminoma and is thus is a useful marker in distinguishing between these germ cell tumors.
The GFAP gene (glial fibrillary acidic protein) is located on chromosome 17q21.
This gene encodes one of the major intermediate filament proteins of mature astrocytes.
It is used as a marker to distinguish astrocytes from other glial cells during development.
Mutations in this gene cause Alexander disease, a rare disorder of astrocytes in the central nervous system.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.
The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a cell-surface receptor that is composed of two polypeptide chains that are linked by a disulfide bond.
In peripheral T-cells, approximately 85% of TCR consist of an alpha and beta chain, while the rest have gamma and delta.
TCRs have multiple domains including constant (C), variable (V), joining (J) and diversity (D) domains.
The TCR beta gene locus (TRB) is located on chromosome 7q34 and includes nearly 70 V genes that are grouped into families ("TRBV families") based upon greater than 75% nucleotide sequence identity.
During T-cell development in the thymus, V, D, and J segments undergo somatic rearrangement to form complete V domain exons that are responsible for antigen recognition.
The diversity of the T-cell repertoire depends on recombination as well as nucleotide insertion and deletion at junctional sites (V-J, D-J, and V-D).
Although nearly 70 TRBV gene segments have been identified, studies have shown that the total number of functional TRBV gene segments expressed by a healthy individual varies from 42 to 47 due to 7 frequently occurring inactivating polymorphisms and a large insertion/deletion-related polymorphism encompassing 2 TRBV gene segments.
TRBV repertoire analysis is used to determine the number of gene segments and their relative frequency as expressed by an individual.
The total number of gene segments present is identified based on various techniques including fragment length analysis, and specific probes are used to identify a common set of gene segments.
From these data, the diversity ratio is calculated as the relative number of gene segments from a particular gene family compared to the total.
Because some portion of gene segments that are counted in the total will not correspond to any of the probes and therefore will not be identified as belonging to a specific TRBV gene family, the total of the diversity ratios reported will not equal 100%.

The Mediterranean Flour Moth, Indian Flour Moth or Mill Moth (Ephestia kuehniella) is a moth of the family Pyralidae.
It is a common pest of dry plant produce - especially cereals - and found around the world.
Salmonella are gram-negative, flagellated, facultative intracellular, anaerobic bacilli with O, H and Vi surface antigens.
Once ingested, Salmonella survives the gastric acid barrier and penetrates the epithelial cells of the small and large intestines.
The invasion of the epithelial cells stimulates the release of cytokines and a subsequent inflammatory response leading to diarrhea and possible ulceration of the mucosa.
Antibodies to Salmonella are the body's defense when the bacteria is outside of its host cell which occurs at the initial infection and when the bacillus moves from cell to cell.
There is a 10 minute window of opportunity when the Salmonella bacillus leaves the macrophage to invade another.
During that time, antibodies and complement work to eradicate the bacilli, but some of the extracellular bacilli will evade attack and enter another host cell.
Studies have shown that vaccines play an important role in the fight against typhoid fever.
There are two species of Salmonella: S. enterica and S. bongori.
These species can be further subclassified into subspecies and serovars.
Veterinary Medicine: Salmonella infection is most often caused by the serovars Salmonella choleraesuis, and Salmonella typhimurium and less often by Salmonella derby.
Infected pigs can be asymptomatic and become carriers of S. choleraesius.
Typically, the bacteria survive in the mesenteric lymph nodes that drain into the intestines, and are not shed in the feces unless the pig is under stress.
The carrier state lasts for weeks to months and is self-limiting.
Severe infection with S. choleraesius can be serious starting out as septicemia and progressing to pneumonia and enteritis.
The infection can spread to various tissues including to the central nervous system leading to meningitis and to the joints where it manifests as arthritis.
Severe infections with S. choleraesius occurs at any age, but most often in pigs 12-14 weeks of age.
Kyphoplasty is a variation of a vertebroplasty that attempts to stop the pain caused by the bone fracture and attempts to restore the height and angle of kyphosis of a fractured vertebra (of certain types), followed by its stabilization using injected bone cement.
The procedure typically includes the use of a small balloon that is inflated in the vertebral body to create a void within the cancellous bone prior to cement delivery.
Once the void is created, the procedure continues in a similar manner as a vertebroplasty, but the bone cement is typically delivered directly into the newly created void.

Insulin is a hormone secreted by the islet cells of the pancreas when an increase in blood glucose is detected.
Insulin attaches to the insulin receptors on the surface of most of the cells.
When insulin binds its receptor, other receptors are activated so that glucose is taken up by the cells.
Intracellular glucose is used as a source of energy.
The COX10 gene (COX10 heme A:farnesyltransferase cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor) is located on chromosome 17p12.
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen.
This component is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes.
The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may function in the regulation and assembly of the complex.
This nuclear gene encodes heme A:farnesyltransferase, which is not a structural subunit but required for the expression of functional COX and functions in the maturation of the heme A prosthetic group of COX.
This protein is predicted to contain 7-9 transmembrane domains localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
A gene mutation, which results in the substitution of a lysine for an asparagine (N204K), is identified to be responsible for cytochrome c oxidase deficiency.
In addition, this gene is disrupted in patients with CMT1A (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A) duplication and with HNPP (hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies) deletion.
The SNCA gene (synuclein, alpha (non A4 component of amyloid precursor)) is located on chromosome 4q21.
Alpha-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family, which also includes beta- and gamma-synuclein.
Synucleins are abundantly expressed in the brain and alpha- and beta-synuclein inhibit phospholipase D2 selectively.
SNCA may serve to integrate presynaptic signaling and membrane trafficking.
Defects in SNCA have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.
SNCA peptides are a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Four alternatively spliced transcripts encoding two different isoforms have been identified for this gene.

Free thyroxine index (FT4I, FTI) is calculated from total hormone (TT4) and any one of the thyroid hormone uptakes - see LOINCs 3050-2 (Triiodothyronine resin uptake, T3RU), 74794-9 (Thyroid hormone binding ratio, THBR), 74793-1 (Classic T-uptake), and 74795-6 (Total thyroxine binding capacity).
It adjusts total hormone levels for the number of binding sites to provide a better picture of thyroid status than total hormone levels.
Results may vary depending on which T-uptake is used.
If that level of distinction is important, users should look to the associated T-uptake code.
However, little reason exists to depend on a Free T4 index today now that Free T4 measures are widely available, accurate and more economical than measuring a T-uptake and a TT4.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that asthma and hayfever are possible following exposure to pollen from this tree; however, no specific studies have been reported to date.
Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), Hurler's disease or gargoylism, is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of mucopolysaccharides due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes.
Without this enzyme, a buildup of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate occurs in the body.
Symptoms appear during childhood and early death can occur due to organ damage.
Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus that affects domesticated housecats worldwide and is the causative agent of feline AIDS.
From 2.5% up to 44% of cats worldwide, and about 2.5% of cats in the USA, are infected with FIV.
FIV differs taxonomically from two other feline retroviruses, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline foamy virus (FFV), and is more closely related to human immunodeficiency virus HIV.
Within FIV, five subtypes have been identified based on nucleotide sequence differences coding for the viral envelope (env) or polymerase (pol).
FIV is the only non-primate lentivirus to cause an AIDS-like syndrome, but FIV is not typically fatal for cats, as they can live relatively healthily as carriers and transmitters of the disease for many years.
A vaccine is available although its efficacy remains uncertain, and cats will test positive for FIV antibodies after vaccination.

Boron is a chemical element with atomic number 5 and the chemical symbol
B. A trivalent metalloid element, boron occurs abundantly in the ore borax.
Boron is never found free in nature.
Several allotropes of boron exist; amorphous boron is a brown powder, though metallic (crystalline) boron is black, hard (9.3 on Mohs' scale), and a weak conductor at room temperature.
Elemental boron is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry, while boron compounds play important roles as light structural materals, nontoxic insecticides and preservatives, and reagents for chemical synthesis.
Boron is an essential plant nutrient, and as an ultratrace mineral is necessary for the optimal health of animals, though its physiological role in animals is poorly understood.
Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt).

Transthyretin (TTR) (originally called prealbumin or thyroxine-binding prealbumin) is a homotetrameric unglycosylated tryptophan rich protein that carries the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, and retinol in serum and CSF.
Synthesized in hepatocytes, TTR and has a molar mass of 55000 daltons.
At a pH of 8.6, an electrophoretic band appears prior to albumin in a relative amount of < 2.5 % due to its greater rate of diffusion to the anode.
Its function is to bind and transport low molecular weight retinol-binding proteins, preventing their glomerular filtration.
30 50 % of circulating TTR is complexed by retinol-binding protein.
Additionally, it binds and transports thyroxine (T4), nevertheless its affinity to this hormone is less than that of thyroxine binding globulin.
TTR is decreased in hepatocellular synthesis caused by acute liver damage, or dietary protein deficiency, and because of its short half life (approximately 2 days) is used as a surrogate marker of nutritional status.
TTR is also a negative acute phase reactive protein and levels decrease in inflammatory states.
Levels can be elevated in chronic renal failure, high concentrations of corticosteroids, and Hodgkin's disease.

Candida auris is a fungus that was first identified in 2009 in Japan and can cause serious infections in the blood, spinal fluid, and internal organs.
This emerging fungus has spread quickly and infections have been documented all over the world.
C auris is difficult to identify with the currently available phenotypic methods used by laboratories, and can be misidentified as other species of yeast.
It is often resistant to multiple drugs, though resistance can differ broadly across isolates.
There are currently no established breakpoints to determine susceptibility, so laboratories have relied on the breakpoints of closely related Candida species or the opinion of experts in mycology.
In the United States, C auris is resistant to fluconazole in 90% of infections, to amphotericin B in 30% of infections, and to echinocandins in 5% of infections.
Patients at highest risk of infection are those that have been hospitalized for a long time, those with indwelling catheters, and those who have been previously treated with antibiotic or antifungal medication.
Symptoms of invasive infection include fever and chills that do not resolve after treatment with antibiotics.
The prostate cancer grade group is based on the 2 values from the Gleason scoring system, but provides what has been suggested to be a simpler and more accurate stratification.
The redefined 5 "grade groups" may have the potential to reduce overtreatment of prostate cancer.
The grade group system has a lowest grade of 1 (instead of 6 for Gleason score), and distinguishes the Gleason scores 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 as 2 separate grades.
N-tau methylimidazoleacetate (N-tau MIAA) is the primary urinary metabolite of histamine.
Increases in N-tau MIAA excretion is associated with systemic mastocytosis, a rare disorder caused by the presence of too many mast cells (mastocytes) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.
Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction and include fatigue, skin lesions and itching, diarrhea, food and drug intolerance, and anaphylaxis.

Alpha-synuclein also known as SNCA is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the SNCA gene.
An alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC) of Alzheimer's disease amyloid, originally found in an amyloid-enriched fraction, is shown to be a fragment of its precursor protein, NACP, by cloning of the full-length cDNA.
Later, NACP turned out to be a human homologue of Torpedo synuclein.
Therefore, NACP is also referred to as human alpha-synuclein.
Normally an unstructured soluble protein, alpha-synuclein can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy.
These disorders are known as synucleinopathies.
Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils.
Occasionally, Lewy bodies contain tau protein, however, alpha-synuclein and tau constitute two distinctive subsets of filaments in the same inclusion bodies.

Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when an individual inherits two copies of a chromosome, or part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent.
UPD can be the result of heterodisomy, in which a pair of non-identical chromosomes are inherited from one parent (an earlier stage meiosis I error) or isodisomy, in which a single chromosome from one parent is duplicated (a later stage meiosis II error).
Because it may lead to the duplication of lethal recessive genes, isodisomy is potentially dangerous, while heterodisomy is essentially benign.
Conditions that occur due to UPD include Prader-Willi syndrome (chromosome 15), Angelman syndrome (chromosome 15), and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (chromosome 11).
Chromosome 14 is also known to cause particular symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation and joint contractures among others.

Certain dietary patterns, including prolonged fasting and high-fat low-carbohydrate dieting, or health conditions such as diabetes, can produce ketosis, thus forming acetone in body tissue.
Ketones can be evaluated due to toxicological causes such as ingestion of isopropanol leading to acetone production.
Acetone is not currently regarded as a carcinogen and is generally recognized to have low acute and chronic toxicity if ingested or inhaled, however at very high vapor concentrations acetone is irritating and may depress the central nervous system.
The protein CD80 (Cluster of Differentiation 80) is a molecule found on activated B cells and monocytes which provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation and survival.
It is also known as B7.1.
Its principal mode of action is by binding to CD28.
Along with CD86, these molecules provide the necessary stimuli to prime T cells against antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells.
CD80 and CD86 also bind to CTLA-4, a cell surface molecule expressed on activated T cells.
Interactions between CD80 or CD86 with CTLA-4 decrease the response of T cells.

Swiss cheese is a generic name common to many countries for several related varieties of cheese which resemble the Swiss Emmental.
Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes".
Swiss cheese has a piquant, but not very sharp taste.
Three types of bacteria are used in the production of Emmental cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subsp.
thermophilus, Lactobacillus (L. helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus), and Propionibacter (P. freudenreichii or P. shermani).
In a late stage of cheese production, the Propionibacter consumes the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria, and releases carbon dioxide gas, which slowly forms the bubbles that develop the eyes.
Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind.

While it is possible to convert between osmolality and osmolarity, thereby deriving a more mathematically correct osmol gap calculation, in actual clinical practice this is not done.
This is because the difference in absolute value of these two measurements that can be attributed to the difference in units will be negligible in a clinical setting.
For this reason, the terms are often used interchangeably, though some object to equating the terms.
Because the calculated osmol gap can therefore be a conflation of both terms (depending on how it is derived), neither term (osmolal gap nor osmolar gap) may be semantically correct.
To avoid ambiguity, the terms "osmolal" and "osmolar" can be used when the units of molality or molarity are consistent throughout the calculation.
When this is not the case, the term "osmol gap" can be used when units are mixed to provide a clinical estimate.
Extra-neuronal catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) metabolite of the catecholamine epinephrine.

Selenium is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
Nutritionally essential for humans, it is a constituent of more than two dozen selenoproteins that play critical roles in reproduction, thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, and protection from oxidative damage and infection.
Selenium exists in two forms: inorganic (selenate and selenite) and organic (selenomethionine and selenocysteine).
Both forms can be good dietary sources of selenium.
Soils contain inorganic selenites and selenates that plants accumulate and convert to organic forms, mostly selenocysteine and selenomethionine and their methylated derivatives.
Most selenium is in the form of selenomethionine in animal and human tissues, where it can be incorporated nonspecifically with the amino acid methionine in body proteins.
Skeletal muscle is the major site of selenium storage.
Seafoods and organ meats are the richest food sources of selenium.
Other sources include muscle meats, cereals and other grains, and dairy products.
The amount of selenium in drinking water is not nutritionally significant in most geographic regions.
Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a protein produced by and used entirely within the thyroid gland.
Thyroglobulin is used by the thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).

Via a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is covalently bound to tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin molecules, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT).
Thyroxine is produced by linking two moieties of DIT.
Combining one particle of MIT and one particle of DIT produces triiodothyronine.
Proteases in lysosomes digest iodinated thyroglobulin, releasing T3 and T4.
Thyroglobulin levels in the blood can be used as a tumor marker for certain kinds of thyroid cancer.
Thyroglobulin levels in the blood can also be elevated in cases of Graves Disease.

Healthy patients have the majority of light chains in serum bound to heavy chains.
Low levels of free light chains (unbound) are normal due to the over-production and secretion of free light chains by plasma cells.
In the kidneys, the free light chains are selectively reabsorbed by the tubular cells, so their presence in urine is likely due to secretion into the urinary tract.
Elevation of monoclonal free light chains in serum or urine signal malignant plasma cell proliferation (multiple myeloma), primary amyloidosis, or light chain deposition disease.
Elevation of polyclonal free light chains suggests autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

Two types of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2.
HIV-1 was initially discovered in the early 1980s and thought to be the sole causative agent of HIV infections and ultimately AIDS.
In 1986, HIV-2 was isolated and also found to cause AIDs.
HIV-1 is more virulent and the predominant cause of the HIV infections worldwide.
HIV-2 is poorly transmitted and is primarily concentrated in West Africa.
Presently (2012), HIV-1 strains are divided into four groups, including group M (major) with subtypes
A through K, group O (outlier), group N (non-M or O), and group P. HIV-2 is divided into subtypes A through E. Occasionally, two viruses of different subtypes can "cross react" and blend their genetic material to create a new hybrid HIV virus.
However, many of these new strains do not survive for long.
Studies have also shown that the core proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 display frequent cross-reactivity whereas the envelope proteins are more type-specific.

Studies between the Japanese and Caucasian population have shown 85 to 90% of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy have DR2/DQ1.
In Blacks, DR5 may be present instead of DR2, however, nearly all have DQ1.
The absence of DQ1 in a patient with negative clinical findings is strong evidence against the diagnosis of narcolepsy.
The LCA5 gene (Leber congenital amaurosis 5) is located on chromosome 6q14.1.
This gene encodes a protein that is thought to be involved in centrosomal or ciliary functions.
Mutations in this gene cause Leber congenital amaurosis type V. Alternatively spliced transcript variants are described.
The inactive proenzyme of trypsin secreted by the pancreas, activated in the duodenum via cleavage by enteropeptidase.
Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are a family of apolipoproteins associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL).
Different isoforms of SAA are expressed constitutively (constitutive SAAs) at different levels or in response to inflammatory stimuli (acute phase SAAs or A-SAAs).
A-SAAs are secreted during the acute phase of inflammation and are implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as amyloidosis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Amyloid A (AA) protein quantification in tissue specimens is a sensitive and specific method for detection of clinical AA amyloidosis.

The Turkey is a New World variety of the pheasant.
The domesticated variety is bred mainly for its meat, a traditional holiday dish in the United States.
Turkeys are conspicuous for their tail plumage, sometimes carried in a fan-like display like that of peacocks, but in more muted colors.
It is estimated that Turkeys have approximately 3500 feathers at maturity
Exposure to 1,2-dichloroethane, a manufactured industrial chemical, usually occurs by breathing contaminated air in workplaces, such as factories, that use 1,2-dichloroethane.
Breathing or ingesting high levels of 1,2-dichloroethane can cause damage to the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and lungs and may cause cancer.
This substance has been found in at least 570 of the 1,585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
One of the three domains of life (the others being Eukarya and Archaea), also called Eubacteria.
They are unicellular prokaryotic microorganisms which generally possess rigid cell walls and multiply by cell division.
They exhibit three principal forms: round or coccal, rodlike or bacillary, and spiral or spirochetal.
Bacteria can be classified by their response to oxygen (aerobic, anaerobic, or facultatively anaerobic) and by how they obtain their energy (chemotrophic, i.e. via a chemical reaction or phototrophic, via a light reaction).
In addition, chemotrophs obtain their energy from chemicals, lithotrophic from inorganic compounds and organotrophic from organic compounds.
Bacteria are also classified by the source carbon that they utilize: heterotrophic, from organic sources or autotrophic, from carbon dioxide.
They can also be classified by whether or not they stain (based on the structure of their cell walls) with crystal violet dye: gram-negative or gram-positive.
A citrate is an ionic form of citric acid, such as C3 H5 O(COO)3 3Ë', that is, citric acid minus three hydrogen ions.
Citrates are compounds containing this group, either ionic compounds, the salts, or analogous covalent compounds, esters.
An example of a salt is sodium citrate and an ester is trimethyl citrate.
Because citric acid is a multifunctional acid, several intermediate ions exist: hydrogen citrate ion, HC6 H5 O7 2Ë' and dihydrogen citrate ion, H2 C6 H5 O7 Ë'.
These may form salts as well, called acid salts.
Salts of the hydrogen citrate ions are weakly acidic, whereas salts of the citrate ion itself (with an inert cation such as sodium ion) are weakly basic.
Influenza B viruses can be separated into two major lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata.
Recent studies have shown that the two major lineages may differ in terms of epidemiology and risk of secondary infection.
One study found that patients with confirmed influenza B Victoria lineage infections were significantly younger compared to patients infected with the Yamagata lineage.
A separate study found that Victoria-lineage viruses were associated with a significantly higher risk of secondary infection among patients' household contacts who were 15 years old or younger than among those older than 15, but the same did not hold true for Yamagata-lineage viruses.
Studies have also shown that genetically distinct lineages like B/Victoria/2/87 can cocirculate in the population and that the reassortment among these strains plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.
Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by many cell types, but especially T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, that is an important mediator of allergic inflammation and disease.
Aneusomy (varying number) of chromosome 7 is evaluated by using a DNA probe that marks the centromeric region of chromosome 7.
Such a probe is also called CEP7.

Drug therapy through parenteral administration is the main route of exposure to penicillin G.
Hepcidin is a peptide hormone primarily synthesized in the liver and essential in regulating dietary iron absorption and distribution.
Hepcidin lowers iron concentrations by counteracting the function of ferroportin, a major cellular iron exporter.
Hepcidin forms include preprohormone (84 amino acids), prohormone (60 amino acids), and hormone (25 amino acids).
Twenty- and 22-amino acid forms of Hepcidin also exist in the urine.
The 25 amino acid form is referred to as the "bioactive" hepcidin since it can block the iron transporter ferroportin.
The N terminal region is required for function and deletion of 5 N-terminal peptides results in a loss of function.
Deficiency in hepcidin-25 concentration is associated with iron loading in hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia's.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid), also known as PTPN22, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PTPN22 gene.
This gene can be expressed in different forms.
PTPN22 affects the responsiveness of T and B cell receptors, and mutations are associated with increases or decreases in risks of autoimmune diseases.
The common 1858T (rs2476601) Arg620Trp nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located in the PTPN22 gene has been associated with autoimmune disorders, including an increased risk of Type 1 Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Vitiligo and Graves' disease, but a decreased risk of Crohn's disease.
A recent study suggests that the mutation does not, on a population basis, reduce life span.
The mutation may be conserved in human evolution because it may provide a hyper-immune response to infectious disease.
Abnormally migrating creatine kinase isoenzyme bands are occasionally seen in electrophoresis panels.
There is no known association with any clinical disorder.
Cystathionine beta-synthase is an enzyme encoded by the CBS gene and converts homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine.
Mutations in the CBS gene disrupt the normal function of cystathionine beta-synthase, causing a build up of homocysteine.

Multiple inhalant allergen screening tests, such as the ImmunoCap Phadiatop and Siemen's IMMULITE Alatop, are used to assess if an inhalant allergy is present in conditions such as asthma and rhinitis.
Each screening test has extracts from various allergens and can be adapted to include locally implicated aero-allergens.
A screening test doesn't indicate which individual allergens are implicated but rather whether there is respiratory allergy or not.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is the antibody found in blood and tissues which causes allergies.
Elevated levels of IgE suggest an inhalant allergy is present.
Urobilin (additionally and formerly known as urochrome) is a yellow linear tetrapyrrole, resulting from the breakdown of heme, a cyclic tetrapyrrole.
The normal yellow color of urine is attributable to urobilin.
Urobilin is produced when Urobilinogen is oxidized by intestinal bacteria; it can also be produced when urobilinogen is exposed to the environment upon urination, resulting in its oxidation to urobilin.
It is a sensitive marker for biliary obstruction, and early acute hepatitis as well.
Factor XI is produced by the liver and encoded by the FII gene.
Deficiency of factor XI causes hemophilia C, an autosomal recessive condition that primarily occurs in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.
Patients with severe factor XI deficiency may develop an inhibitor to factor XI after infusion of fresh frozen plasma or factor XI concentrates.
Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv) is a large-enveloped RNA virus, which is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family.
The complete PEDv genome consists of 5 gene segments: open reading frame 1 (ORF1), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N).
It is encapsulated by a single N protein.
The S protein contributes to the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies in the infected host.
Its association to adapted growth in vitro and attenuation in vivo lends itself to use for genetic comparison among PEDV isolates and effective vaccines.
The M protein is required for assembly and can also induce the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies.
The E protein contributes to coronavirus budding.
The N protein has functions associated with viral replication and pathogenesis.
PEDv causes viral enteritis, which leads to the destruction of villus enterocytes in pigs of all ages.
It is spread by the ingestion of feces from infected pigs, resulting in vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality, especially in nursery piglets.
Disease caused by PEDv is clinically similar to that caused by Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)
At least two PEDv strains have been identified in the USA: the US PEDv prototype and S INDEL variant.
The INDEL variant PEDv strain has insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the spike (S) gene.
The INDEL strain is related to milder clinical signs than prototype strains.
The genomic differences in the S gene between the US PEDv prototype and INDEL variant may be responsible for the virulence differences.
Potential targets when testing for PEDv RNA include the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and the ~2500 bp fragment of the S-gene.
The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the Mycoplasma hyosynoviae is generally used to show the genomic diversity in various anatomical sites of pigs and geographical regions where the organism is found.
3-Hydroxytrimethyl-L-lysine is found within the Lysine degradation (aka L-carnitine biosynthesis)
pathway; it is a byproduct of trimethyllysine dioxygenase (trimethyllysine hydroxylase,, which converts trimethyllysine + 2-oxoglutarate to 3-Hydroxytrimethyl-L-lysine + succinate.
Patients with X-linked trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLHE) deficiency, a carnitine deficiency disorder associated with autism, have lower than expected levels of carnitine as well as 3-Hydroxytrimethyl-L-lysine, and elevated levels of trimethyllysine.

A document containing the list of tasks to be completed.
The purpose of this document is to ensure that no step is missed or forgotten.
Parietal cells are epithelial cells which secrete acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor into the stomach.
Acid is required for proper digestion of food and Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of Vitamin B12 in the small intestine.
An inbalance of either will cause disease.
Excessive acid production can cause peptic ulcers.
Autoantibodies against the parietal cells or intrinsic factor cause either a reduction in vitamin B12 absorption (pernicious anemia) or Achlorydria, where the parietal cells are damaged, unable to produce enough gastric acid, causing an increased pH in the stomach, leading to digestive problems and an increase in the risk of gastroenteritis (an inflammation of the GI tract).
5b-Cholestane-3a,7a,12a,24,25-pentol has been found excreted in the urine from a patient with sitosterolemia as glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids.
The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of a Hepatitis B virus infection.
It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear.
Shortly after the appearance of the HBsAg, another antigen called hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear.
Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a patient's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the hepatitis B virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true.
During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards.
This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.
Nalidixic acid is the basis for quinolone antibiotics.
It acts bacteriostatically (that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction) or bactericidally (it kills them) on both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, depending on the concentration.
It is especially used in treating urinary tract infections, caused for example by Escherichia coli, Proteus, shigella, Enterobacter and Klebsiella.

The APC gene (adenomatous polyposis coli) is located on chromosome 5q21-q22.
This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway.
It is also involved in other processes including cell migration and adhesion, transcriptional activation, and apoptosis.
Defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy.
Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product.
Antibodies against metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1) are associated with a rare autoimmune encephalitis.

Trichothecenes are a very large family of chemically related mycotoxins produced by various species of Fusarium, Myrothecium, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, Cephalosporium, Verticimonosporium, and Stachybotrys.
Trichothecenes belong to sesquiterpene compounds.
The most important structural features causing the biological activities of trichothecenes are: the 12,13-epoxy ring, the presence of hydroxyl or acetyl groups at appropriate positions on the trichothecene nucleus and the structure and position of the side-chain.
They are produced on many different grains like wheat, oats or maize by various Fusarium species such as F. graminearum, F. sporotrichioides, F. poae and F. equiseti.
Some molds that produce trichothecene mycotoxins, such as Stachybotrys chartarum, can grow in damp indoor environments.
It has been found that macrocyclic trichothecenes produced by Stachybotrys chartarum can become airborne and thus contribute to health problems among building occupants.
The poisonous mushroom in Japan and China, Podostroma cornu-damae contains six trichothecenes; satratoxin H, roridin E, verrucarin and others.

The GFM1 gene (G elongation factor, mitochondrial 1) is located on chromosome 3q25.
Eukaryotes contain two protein translational systems, one in the cytoplasm and one in the mitochondria.
Mitochondrial translation is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and mutations in this system lead to a breakdown in the respiratory chain-oxidative phosphorylation system and to impaired maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.
This gene encodes one of the mitochondrial translation elongation factors.
Its role in the regulation of normal mitochondrial function and in different disease states attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction is not known.

Products containing this drug are sold under a wide variety of names including (but not limited to)
Spice, Potpourri, Smoke, K2, Zombie, Kush, and Cloud 10.
Human Leukocyte Antigen B*27 (subtypes B*2701-2724) is a class I surface antigen encoded by the B locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6.
It presents microbial antigens to T-cells and is strongly associated with certain immunity diseases (SpA spondyloarthropathies).
In the general population, about 8% Caucasian, 4% African, 2-9% Chinese, and 0.1-0.5% Japanese have the HLA-B27 antigen.
In Northern Scandinavia (Lapland), 24% of people are HLA-B27 positive while 1.8% have ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
Mystery:The relationship between HLA-B27 and many diseases has not yet been fully elucidated.
Though it is associated with a wide range of pathology, it does not appear to be the sole mediator in development of disease.
For example, while nearly all people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are HLA-B27 positive, only a fraction of people with HLA-B27 ever develop AS.
Antibodies found in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients that are directed against gamma-chain immunoglobulins.

The mean blood glucose levels are 10-15% lower than those of plasma.
The FSHD gene (facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 1A) gene is located on chromosome 4q35.
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common hereditary disease of muscle.
Patients with FSHD have a chromosomal rearrangement within the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4 (4q35).
This region is composed mainly of a polymorphic repeat structure consisting of 3.3 kb repeat units, designated D4Z4.
The number of repeat units varies from 10 to more than 100 in the population, however, in FSHD patients only 1-10 repeat units is observed because of a deletion of an integral number of these units.
FSHD is caused by an epigenetic mechanism involving the contraction of a subtelomeric macrosatellite repeat, which results in marked hypomethylation of the contracted D4Z4 allele.
It is likely not the structure, but the deregulation of transcription of one or more genes as a result of repeat-contraction-mediated chromatin alterations, that causes FSHD.
HPV type 45 has been associated with low grade cervical abnormalities, cancer precursors, and anogenital cancers.
Avian paramyxoviruses are in the genera Avulavirus.

The stringy elastic character of cervical mucus during the ovulatory period.
The NAGS gene (N-acetylglutamate synthase) is located on chromosome 17q21.31.
The N-acetylglutamate synthase gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the formation of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl coenzyme-A. NAG is a cofactor of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI), the first enzyme of the urea cycle in mammals.
This gene may regulate ureagenesis by altering NAG availability and, thereby, CPSI activity.
Deficiencies in N-acetylglutamate synthase have been associated with hyperammonemia.
Complement total hemolytic CH50 testing is used to monitor Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients' response to therapy.
It is also used to evaluate complement component deficiency, complement activity in patients with immune complexes, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cryoglobulinemia.
Complement is a system of 25 proteins associated with cell membranes and present in plasma; it plays a vital role in the function of the immune system.
Complement components function in the "classical" and "alternative" pathways.
The CH50 assay mainly evaluates the classical pathway.
Complement proteins are activated during the acute phase of inflammation or infection.
Decreased levels of complement components occur during hypercatabolism, expenditure in immune complexes or due to hereditary deficiency.
Decreasing complement levels may signal upcoming clinical problems, especially lupus nephritis.

Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is the major metabolite of the catecholamines.
Increased levels of VMA are often seen in patients with pheochromocytoma.
VMA levels are of value for evaluation of hypertension, diagnosis and follow up of neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma, and ganglioneuroblastoma.
Urinary VMA is increased in about 90% of patients with neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma patients with a Homovanillic acid (HVA) to VMA ratio of less than 1 or greater than 2 have an unfavorable prognosis.
Elevated VMA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without a concomitant elevation of urine VMA may be a marker for neuroectodermal brain tumors and could potentially be used to monitor treatment efficacy.
White hickory, closely related to the Pecan (Hickory) tree (Carya pecan), is a member of the Juglandaceae (Walnut) family and is the most abundant of the Hickories.
The Carya or Hickory genus comprises 17 species, of which 15 are found in the United States, 1 in Mexico and 1 in southern China.
In the United States, Hickories are found principally in the eastern states and not in the Pacific states.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that asthma and hayfever are possible following exposure to pollen from this tree; however, no specific studies on this have been reported to date.
Indolamines are a family of neurotransmitters that share a common molecular structure (namely, indolamine).
A common example of an indolamine is serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter involved in mood and sleep.
Another example of an indolamine is melatonin, which regulates the sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm) in humans.
In biochemistry, indoleamines are substituted indole compounds that contain an amino group.
Examples of indoleamines are the tryptamines, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) and the lysergamides.
Also, histamines are a part of the indolamine family.
Histamines are synthesized by the amino acid histidine.
The two antigens of the Yt system, Yt^a and Yt^b, are both expressed at birth, however in a slightly lower expression level than seen on adult cells.
They were shown to be resistant to trypsin treatment, but sensitive to other protein cleaving enzymes.
Antibodies to these antigens were implicated in cases of delayed transfusion reactions but were not reported to have caused hemolytic disease of the newborn.
No examples of Yt(a-b-) individuals have been found despite numerous studies.
From population studies, Yt^b appeared to be lacking, or of very low incidence, from Orientals, Amer-Indians and southern Africans; Yta was found lacking in approximately one per thousand individuals of European origin.
This system remained unexciting until it was found that both of these antigens were weak or absent from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) III red blood cells.
With a rush of activity in the early 1990's, it was found that the Yt blood group system antigens represented amino acid substitutions on the GPI-linked glycoprotein, acetylcholinesterase (AchE).
This protein probably exists as a dimer (pair) in the red cell membrane.
Yta and Ytb are equated to substitutions of a hisitidine and asparagine, respectively, at amino acid position 322 on the GPI-linked glycoprotein.
AChE has been assigned a chromosome location at 7q22.

8-hydroxyloxapine is an inactive metabolite of loxipine, an anti-psychotic drug that is used to treat psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.
8-hydroxyloxapine has higher concentrations in plasma and urine than 7-hydroxyloxapine (the active metabolite of loxapine), which makes 8-hydroxyloxapine a better biomarker for loxapine.)
HIV enters cells by attaching first to the CD4 receptor and then to either the CCR5 or CXCR4 molecules, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.
CCR5 coreceptor antagonists prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to the CCR5 receptors.
HIV tropism assays determine whether the HIV binds to CCR5, CXCR4 or both.
An HIV tropism assay should be performed whenever the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered or a patient has virologic failure on a CCR5 antagonist.
During acute or recent infection, the vast majority of patients harbor a CCR5-binding virus (called R5 tropism), which suggests that the R5 variant is preferentially transmitted.
Viruses in many untreated patients exhibit a shift in co-receptor tropism from CCR5 usage to either CXCR4 (X4 tropism) or both (D/M-tropic, which stands for dual or mixed), which is associated with a more rapid decline in CD4 T-cell counts.
Patients who have been treated with anti-retroviral drugs and who have extensive drug resistance are more likely to harbor X4- or D/M-tropic variants than untreated patients with comparable CD4 counts.
The prevalence of X4- or D/M-tropic variants increases to more than 50% in treated patients who have CD4 counts <100 cells/mm3.
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the cells of the prostate gland.
PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of normal men, and is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer and in other prostate disorders.
A blood test to measure PSA is the most effective test currently available for the early detection of prostate cancer.
Higher than normal levels of PSA are associated with both localized and metastatic prostate cancer (CaP).

Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is one species of Erysipelothrix, which are facultative anaerobic, gram-positive rods that are distributed worldwide and have been isolated from both birds and mammals.
Other species of Erysipelothrix are E. tonsillarum, E. sp strain 1, and E. sp strain 2.
The clinical disease caused by these organisms is called "erysipelas" in animals and "erysipeloid" in humans.
Disease caused by E. rhusiopathiae that affects swine and turkeys has the most economic impact.
Swine erysipelas is most often caused by serotypes 1a, 1b and 2, which are all members of the rhusiopathiae species.
Three presentations are recognized: acute, subacute, and chronic.
Up to half of healthy pigs may harbor E. rhusiopathiae in tonsils and lymphatic tissue.
Acute erysipelas outbreaks are likely due to shedding by subclinically affected animals in urine, feces, saliva, and nasal secretions.

Rotaviruses cause significant gastrointestinal disease, primarily in children under 5 years old.
Rotaviruses comprise a genus within the family Reoviridae with nine existing groups.
Groups A, B and C (RVA, RVB and RVC) infect humans while all existing groups can infect animals.
RV causes diarrhea by destroying the enterocytes in the small intestine.
Recent studies confirm that rotavirus infection can also extend beyond the intestine.
Examples of extraintestinal infection include the findings of the virus in the liver during autopsy, elevated liver enzymes during active infection and the demonstration of the virus replicating both in the liver and kidneys of a child suffering from immunodeficiency.
Rotaviruses (RVs) also cause severe diarrhea in animals.
Research has revealed that pigs can suffer both single and mixed concurrent infections with more than one Rotavirus group.
In one study, pigs that had been vaccinated against one strain of RVA were still part of a diarrhea outbreak later and found to have both single and mixed infections that included RVB, RVC and RVH as well as RVA strains that were not part of the vaccine.
This suggests that diagnostic testing for multiple RV groups should be included when testing a swine herd for enteric diseases even after they have been vaccinated against a single strain.
Cefaloridine (or cephaloridine) is a cephalosporin.
It is unique among cephalosporins in that it exists as a zwitterion.

The expanded coverage of this combination makes it a useful alternative when penicillin resistance is present and patients cannot tolerate alternative treatments.
Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rod found on plants, in soil, water and the intestinal tracts of animals.
Eight exotoxins (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F and G) have been identified, all of which interfere with neural transmission by blocking the release of acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction.
The toxins are used in the clinical management of various spastic medical conditions, strabismus and focal dystonias, hemifacial spasms, headaches, hyper-salivation and hyperhidrosis.
Type A is the most potent toxin.
In 2002 it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cosmetological uses.
It is administered by injection into muscles or glands with the effects lasting approximately three months.
Most patients require multiple treatments over many years and some develop tolerance to the injections due to the development of neutralizing antibodies to the toxin.
Side effects are minor and transient.

Tryptamine is found in trace amounts in the brains of mammals and is believed to play a role as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter.
Tryptamine is also the backbone for a group of compounds known collectively as tryptamines.
This group includes many biologically active compounds, including neurotransmitters and psychedelic drugs.
African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever.
ASFV infects domestic pigs, warthogs and bushpigs, as well as soft ticks.
The virus causes a lethal haemorraghic disease in domestic pigs, some isolates can cause death of animals within as little as a week after infection.
In all of the other species the virus causes no obvious disease.
ASFV is endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa and exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between ticks and wild pigsbushpigswarthogs.
ASFV was first described after European settlers brought pigs into areas endemic with ASFV and as such is an example of an 'emerging infection'.
The virus itself is a large DNA virus with a genome containing at least 150 genes.
The number of genes differs slightly between different isolates of the virus.
ASFV has similarities to the other large DNA viruses e.g., poxvirus, iridovirus, mimivirus.
More recently ASFV has been associated with AIDS as a possible causal agent.
The TYROBP gene (TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein) is located on chromosome 19q13.1.
This gene encodes a transmembrane signaling polypeptide which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain.

Phosphatidylglycerol is a glycerophospholipid found in pulmonary surfactant.
The general structure of phosphatidylglycerol consists of a L-glycerol 3-phosphate backbone ester-bonded to either saturated or unsaturated fatty acids on carbons 1 and 2.
The head group substituent glycerol is bonded through a phosphomonoester.
It is the precursor of surfactant and its presence in the amniotic fluid of the newborn indicates fetal lung maturity.
Approximately 98% of alveolar wall surface area is due to the presence of type I cells, with type II cells producing pulmonary surfactant covering around 2% of the alveolar walls.
Once surfactant is secreted by the type II cells, it must be spread over the remaining type I cellular surface area.
Phosphatidylglycerol is thought to be important in spreading of surfactant over the Type I cellular surface area.
The major surfactant deficiency in premature infants is associated with the lack of phosphatidylglycerol, even though it comprises less than 5% of pulmonary surfactant phospholipids.
Substituted amphetamines are a chemical class of stimulants, entactogens, hallucinogens, and other drugs.
They feature a phenethylamine core with a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon resulting in amphetamine, along with additional substitutions.
Examples of amphetamines are amphetamine, methamphetamine, ephedrine, cathinone, MDMA ("Ecstasy"), and DOM ("STP").
Amphetamine derivatives occur in nature, for example in the leaves of Ephedra and khat plants.
These have been used since antiquity for their pharmacological effects.
Such synthetic amphetamines found use as decongestants in the symptomatic treatment of colds and also occasionally as psychoactive agents.
Their effects on the central nervous system are diverse, but can be summarized by three overlapping types of activity: psychoanaleptic, hallucinogenic and empathogenic.
Various amphetamines may cause these actions either separately or in combination.
Improper consumption of amphetamine derivatives may result in addiction and aggressiveness, as well as in rapid deterioration of basic body functions and death.
Therefore, production and distribution of most related drugs are controlled by the authorities both nationally and internationally.

Cholesterol is an essential lipid present in all cells.
Cholesterol is needed in order to construct hormones, metabolites, and Vitamin D. Cholesterol travels throughout the bloodstream with the aid of two lipoproteins: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
LDL carries cholesterol from the liver to other parts of the body and HDL carries cholesterol from other parts of the body to the liver where it can be broken down.
HDL is considered "good cholesterol" because it removes excess cholesterol from the blood and into the liver where it can be disposed of properly.
A higher level of HDL can decrease the risk for heart disease and atherosclerosis.
When observing the blood HDL levels, less than 40 mg/dL is too low (high risk for heart disease), 40-59 mg/dL is average, and 60 mg/dL or higher is optimal (low risk for heart disease).

Four species of the Plasmodium protozoa are considered true parasites of humans as they use humans almost exclusively as a natural intermediate host: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae.
Malaria today is usually restricted to tropical and subtropical areas and altitudes below 1,500 m., although in the past malaria was endemic in much of North America, Europe and even parts of northern Asia, and today is still present on the Korean peninsula.
However, this present distribution could be affected by climatic changes and population movements.
P. falciparum is the most prevalent species and responsible for the most morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Early detect is of paramount importance due to the incidence of cerebral malaria and drug resistance.
Malarial infections caused by P. falciparum are the most likely to progress to severe, potentially fatal forms with central nervous system involvement (cerebral malaria), acute renal failure, severe anemia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Natural (native) Prunus persica (nPru p) 3 is a lipid transfer protein (LTP) isolated from peach skin and pulp.
It is used to evaluate specific IgE reactivity in patients with suspected peach allergy.
While peach LTP is typically the primary allergic sensitizer, cross-reactivity to LTP of other taxonomically related or unrelated plants may be responsible for peach allergy in some patients.
The classification "abnormal lymphocyte" includes both variant lymphocytes (also known as atypical or reactive) and malignant lymphocytes (i.e., lymphoma cells).
Lymphoma cells are sometimes difficult to distinguish from variant lymphocytes by microscopy alone.
A few features that can help distinguish the two are the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, the shape of the nucleus, and cell heterogeneity.
Variant lymphocytes have moderately abundant cytoplasm and oval nuclei with with notches or indentations and are heterogeneous in size and shape within a single smear.
Lymphoma cells have less cytoplasm, nuclei that are round or oval with slight indentations and tend to have a more homogeneous appearance within a single smear.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common genetic cardiac disease (~0.2% of the general population) defined by the presence of unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
The clinical spectrum of HCM is heterogeneous with respect to disease-causing mutations, presentation, prognosis, and treatment strategies.
HCM is most commonly caused by mutations in one of the genes (e.g. MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1) that encode different components of the sarcomere.
Such mutations are found in approximately 50%-60% individuals with a family history of HCM, and approximately 20%-30% of individuals without a family history of HCM.
Other nonsarcomeric genes, such as CSRP3 (encoding muscle LIM protein), are also found to be associated with HCM by genome-wide linkage studies.
A variety of multi-gene analysis panels are available for HCM.
The genes included and corresponding detection rate will vary between laboratories and over time within the same laboratory.

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is targeted sequence analysis of the protein-coding region of the human genome.
The exome represents less than 2% of the genome but is estimated to contain about 85% of known disease-related variants.
Variant types include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small DNA insertions or deletions (indels), copy number variants (CNVs), or other structural variants (SVs).
WES and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) are performed to identify the cause of heritable diseases and for various other applications, including population genetics and cancer studies.
Sequencing only the coding regions of the genome is currently less expensive than WGS since less genetic material is sequenced.
A species of fish in the cod family Gadidae, known as the Atlantic cod, It is one of the most important commercial fishes.
alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid (2-hydroxyglutaric acid) is an alpha hydroxy acid.
In humans the compound is formed by a Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase whereas in bacteria is formed by a 2-hydroxyglutarate synthase.
The compound can be converted to alpha-Ketoglutaric acid through the action of a 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase which, in humans, are two enzymes called D2HGDH and L2HGDH.
Deficiency in either of these two enzymes lead to a disease known as 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria.
This panel represents the COOP/WONCA Charts for adult/geriatric patients with a 1-10 numeric rating scale.
Images included with each term display the charts and indicate in color (red, green, yellow) the usual score "cutoffs" in clinical settings.
The Dartmouth-Northern New England Primary Care Cooperative Information Project (Dartmouth CO-OP Project) chart system has been developed to assess the functional status of adults and adolescents.
The dimensions of health status measured by the health charts are: Physical, Emotional, Daily Activities, Social Activities, Social Support, Pain, and Overall Health.
Two main versions of the COOP Charts exist: the original CO-OP charts and the CO-OP/WONCA version (this panel).
The WONCA version has been developed as the international standard for classifying the functional status of adult patients in primary care settings.
This version differs from the original CO-OP Charts by asking about function in the previous 2 weeks (rather than 4 weeks).
Several variations of the COOP charts also exists and scoring across instruments varies (e.g. 1-10 where 10 is worst, 1-5 where 5 is worst, and some even reverse the numbers).
For scoring, typically the patient's answers, or scores, for each chart are recorded as-is in the patient's medical record; no scoring algorithm or computing is necessary.
A summative total score is not recommended by the developers, however some users may be recording it.

The CACNA1A gene (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, P/Q type, alpha 1A subunit) is located on chromosome 19p13.
Voltage-dependent calcium channels mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells, and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, and gene expression.
Calcium channels are multisubunit complexes composed of alpha-1, beta, alpha-2/delta, and gamma subunits.
The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming alpha-1 subunit, whereas, the others act as auxiliary subunits regulating this activity.
The distinctive properties of the calcium channel types are related primarily to the expression of a variety of alpha-1 isoforms, alpha-1A, B, C, D, E, and S.
This gene encodes the alpha-1A subunit, which is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue.
Mutations in this gene are associated with 2 neurologic disorders, familial hemiplegic migraine and episodic ataxia 2.
This gene also exhibits polymorphic variation due to (CAG)n-repeats.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
In one set of transcript variants, the (CAG)n-repeats occur in the 3' UTR, and are not associated with any disease.
But in another set of variants, an insertion extends the coding region to include the (CAG)n-repeats which encode a polyglutamine tract.
Expansion of the (CAG)n-repeats from the normal 4-16 to 21-28 in the coding region is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 6.

Bartonella quintana is a slim, fastidious coccobacillus spread through body lice.
It is most commonly associated with trench fever, but can cause bacillary splenitis, bacteremia, as well as other diseases.
B. quintana is present across the globe and is most commonly found in impoverished, crowded and unhygienic conditions such as refugee or homeless camps..
A combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) are used to detect Bartonella quintana and distinguish it from other Bartonella species.
A benzodiazepine that acts as a GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID modulator and anti-anxiety agent.
Parechovirus is a viral genus in the family Picornaviridae and contains two species, Human parechovirus (HPeV) and Ljungan virus (LV).
HPeVs cause various diseases, including aseptic meningitis, gastroenteritis, encephalitis, acute respiratory illness, and neonatal sepsis-like disease.
LVs may be involved with diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, myocarditis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Methods such as real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) are performed to detect members of the genus Parechovirus.
Some RT-PCR assay can detect both HPeVs and LVs targeting the conserved regions in the 5' nontranslated region (5'NTR) of the parechovirus genome.
Other assays target only known HPeVs or only LVs.
Telomeres are DNA-protein structures located at the end of each chromosome and containing long stretches of (TTAGGG) in repeats of variable length (3-20kb).
They protect chromosomes from deterioration and prevent fusion with other chromosomes.
The region adjacent to the telomeric repeats is called the subtelomere, which also contains segments of repetitive stretches of DNA.
Subtelomeres are found to be relatively gene-rich due to frequent duplication and recombination events.
Deletions and rearrangements in subtelomere regions have been associated with mental retardation and congenital abnormalities.
Cytogenetic analysis of subtelomeres is difficult due to low resolution using conventional banding techniques.
FISH probes specific for subtelomeric regions on both the long and short arms of chromosomes are useful for detecting subtle rearrangements.

Allo-tetrahydrocortisol (5a-Tetrahydrocortisol) is a normal human metabolite.
However its increased ratio (5alpha-Tetrahydrocortisol + Tetrahydrocortisol) over Tetrahydrocortisone in urine is the biochemical marker for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).
AME is a heritable form of hypertension due to an inborn error of cortisol metabolism and is characterized by hypokalemia and low renin levels despite subnormal or normal levels of aldosterone and other known mineralocorticoids.
The syndrome is attributable to congenital deficiency of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD), which converts cortisol to biologically inactive cortisone.
This results in a prolonged half-life of Cortisol, which acts at the kidney level as a potent mineralocorticoid. .
Giardia is the microscopic organism that causes giardiasis, an intestinal infection that affects people or animals.
Giardia is found in water and on contaminated surfaces.
The troponin test is used to help diagnose a heart attack, to detect and evaluate mild to severe heart injury, and to distinguish chest pain that may be due to other causes.
Troponin values can remain high for 1-2 weeks after a heart attack.
The test is not affected by damage to other muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect troponin levels.
Troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance.
Beta interferon is a recombinant protein which is chemically identical to or similar to endogenous interferon beta with antiviral and anti-tumor activities.
Endogenous interferons beta are cytokines produced by nucleated cells (predominantly natural killer cells) upon exposure to live or inactivated virus, double-stranded RNA or bacterial products.
These agents bind to specific cell-surface receptors, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes with an interferon-specific response element.
The proteins so produced mediate many complex effects, including antiviral (the most important being inhibition of viral protein synthesis), antiproliferative and immune modulating effects.
The recombinant therapeutic forms of interferon beta are interferon beta 1-a and interferon beta 1-b.
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Cetuximab competes to bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGRF) and then subsequently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.
Cetuximab is used in conjunction with radiation in the treatment of SCCHN.
It is also used as the sole therapy for SCCHN in instances of recurrent or metastatic disease where platinum-based therapy was not effective.
In patients with mCRC cetuximab is used in combination with irinotecan or by itself in patients who are unable to tolerate irinotecan.
Some patients develop treatment-related hypersensitivity to cetuximab and detection of anti-cetuximab IgE may help physicians identify patients at risk of a severe infusion reaction.

Haemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as Haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or Erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus, when the IgG antibodies that have been produced by the mother and have passed through the placenta include ones which attack the red blood cells in the fetal circulation.
The red cells are broken down and the fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anaemia.
This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur.
When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts are present in the foetal blood and so these forms of the disease can be called erythroblastosis fetalis (or erythroblastosis foetalis).
Increased levels of lipoprotein (a) are observed in patients with coronary artery disease, stroke, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease and rarely in venous thrombosis.
Substantial increases are observed in nephrotic syndrome and end-state renal disease.
DecreasedlLipoprotein (a) levels may be seen in several rare disorders such as lecithin:cholesterol acyltranferase deficiency, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and liver disease).
Levels in African Americans may be 2 to 3 times higher than in Caucasians and Asians whereas Native Americans and Mexican Americans have lower levels than in Caucasians and Asians.
Information from Quest Diagnostics.
Lipoprotein (a) is an LDL cholesterol particle that is attached to a special protein called apo(a).
In large part, a person's level of Lp(a) is genetically inherited.
Elevated levels of Lp(a), higher than 20 mg/dL to 30 mg/dL in the blood are linked to a greated likelihood of atherosclerosis and heart attacks in both men and women.
(The risk is even more significant if the Lp(a) cholesterol elevation is accompanied by high LDL/HDL ratios.)
It accounts for only 15% of cholesterol so elevations can be missed in patients with normal cholesterols.
Has 95% homology with plasminogen and possible interesting biologic relation to other phenomenon.

The MAP2K1 gene (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1) is located on chromosome 15q22.1-q22.33.
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity protein kinase family, which acts as a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase.
MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals.
This protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinases and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinases upon wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals.
As an essential component of MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, this kinase is involved in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development.

Ammonia (NH3) is produced in the body as a byproduct of the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds, is processed in the liver to form urea which is ultimately eliminated in the urine.
Elevated blood concentrations of ammonia are toxic and can lead to brain damage, coma and death.
Testing of ammonia levels is most commonly performed to monitor various diseases and less so for occupational exposure or poisoning.
Conditions associated with elevated ammonia include severe liver disease, Reye syndrome, kidney failure, and certain rare genetic diseases.
Ammonia levels may also be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.
The dinoflagellates are a large group of flagellate protists.
Most are marine plankton, but they are common in fresh water habitats as well.
Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth.
About half of all dinoflagellates are photosynthetic, and these make up the largest group of eukaryotic algae aside from the diatoms.
Being primary producers makes them an important part of the aquatic food chain.
Some species, called zooxanthellae, are endosymbionts of marine animals and protozoa, and play an important part in the biology of coral reefs.
Other dinoflagellates are colorless predators on other protozoa, and a few forms are parasitic (see for example Oodinium, Pfiesteria).
An algal bloom of dinoflagellates can result in a visible coloration of the water colloquially known as red tide.
Research has shown that individuals who have direct contact to pigs are highly likely to develop antibodies to porcine origin antigens, such as avian-like H1N1, human-like H3N2, and the pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009.
In addition to the likelihood of developing antibodies, they are at a higher risk of infection.
Endotoxins (not to be confused with enterotoxin) are toxins associated with certain bacteria.
An "endotoxin" is a toxin that is a structural molecule of the bacteria that is recognized by the immune system.
It differs from exotoxins in that it is not produced by the bacteria to have an effect or to be toxic to its host.
The presence of endotoxins in the blood is called endotoxemia.
It can lead to septic shock, if the immune response is severely pronounced.
Moreover, endotoxemia of intestinal origin is considered to be an important factor in the development of alcoholic hepatitis, which is likely to develop on the basis of the small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome and an increased intestinal permeability.
Methcathinone is an illicit drug also known as ephedrone, which is a methyl derivative of cathinone, a stimulant found in the khat plant, Catha edulis.
It is a substance of abuse and can be easily manufactured via the oxidation of pseudoephedrin.
Methcathinone abuse is a significant cause of parkinsonism among young patients in Eastern European countries.
The final mixture contains a high concentration of manganese if potassium permanganate is used as the oxidant agent.
The use of manganese-contaminated methcathinone may cause permanent neurological damage and severe disability.
Drug users develop a distinctive extrapyramidal syndrome that resembles classic manganese intoxication.
Methcathinone could have additive neurotoxic effect to the progression of parkinsonism.
Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant used with other medication to treat epileptic seizures and to facilitate the recovery from episodes of depression, mania, and other abnormal moods in patients with bipolar I disorder.
Methotrexate (MTX) is a drug that is used to treat certain types of cancer as well as auto-immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis.
After uptake of MTX into cells, MTX is activated by the addition of glutamate residues and forms methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX-PGs), which are named based on the number of added glutamate residues (e.g. methotrexate triglutamate, MTX-PG3).
The half-life of MTX in plasma is only several hours where as MTX PGs can persist in cells for weeks or months.
While high-dose MTX in the treatment of malignancy is due to the direct effect on tetrahydrofolate reductase and DNA synthesis, the long-term immune modulation of low-dose MTX therapy appears to be related to multiple metabolic effects of the MTX PGs.
Red blood cell MTX PG levels may be a marker for therapeutic response in patients treated with low-dose MTX, and low red blood cell MTX PG has been associated with poor clinical status in patients with RA.
Phoma is a genus of common coelomycetous soil fungi.
It contains many plant pathogenic species.
About 140 Phoma taxa have been defined and recognized which may be divided into two large groups: (i) plurivorous fungi, generally saprobic or weakly parasitic, mainly from temperate regions in Eurasia, but occasionally also found in other parts of the world (including areas with cool or warm climates); and (ii) specific pathogens of cultivated plants.
Spores are colorless and unicellular.
The pycnidia are black and depressed in the tissues of the host.
Phoma is arbitrarily limited to those species in which the spores are less than 15 Âµm as the larger spored forms have been placed in the genus Macrophoma.
The most important species include Phoma beta which is the cause of the heart rot and blight of beets, Phoma batata that produces a dry rot of sweet potato, and Phoma solani.

Blomia tropicalis, a Storage mite, was earlier found predominantly in agricultural environments but is now being recognised as an important contributor to the allergen content in house dust in indoor urban dwellings.
B. tropicalis is a notable mite species in many parts of the world, and the most common and most important mite species in tropical countries Several investigations have demonstrated that allergens from B. tropicalis may play an important role in sensitisation and allergic symptoms.
Sensitisation to B. tropicalis has been associated with acute asthma that requires emergency room treatment both among children and adults
Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes are resistance enzymes produced by pathogenic organisms such as E. coli and Klebsiella.
The presence of ESBLs can be detected by comparing the inhibitory concentration (IC) of a specific antimicrobial, such as cefepime (a 4th generation cephalosporin), cefotaxime, or ceftazidime (both 3rd generation cephalosporins), with the IC of that antimicrobial plus clavulanate, an ESBL inhibitor.
A nucleoside consisting of the base guanine and the sugar deoxyribose.
It is like guanosine, but with one oxygen atom removed.
It is a nucleoside component of DNA.
Deoxyguanosine can be converted to 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) due to hydroxyl radical attack at the C8 of guanine.
8-OHdG is a sensitive marker of the DNA damage This damage, if left unrepaired, has been proposed to contribute to mutagenicity and cancer promotion.
Interferon beta-1a is a drug (Avonex, Rebif) in the interferon family used to treat multiple sclerosis.
It is produced by mammalian cells while Interferon beta-1b is produced in modified E. coli.
Interferons have been shown to have about a 18-38% reduction in the rate of MS relapses, and to slow the progression of disability in MS patients.
The JMH blood group was first identified by autoantibodies usually found in elderly men whose red cells exhibited a positive direct antiglobulin test.
When found in women they too were elderly and were often cat owners; hence the earlier nicknames of this collection of specificities was "The Boys" and "Cat".
The name was eventually assigned based upon the initials of one of the most thoroughly investigated propositi.
Only one family to date has been shown to have an inherited JMH negative phenotype while the majority of the JMH negatives are due to an acquired suppression of the antigen.
As with many of the early reports, anti-JMH was believed to be a single specificity.
However, the Meged serum (and later others) showed that other polymorphic determinants were involved in the JMH phenotype.

Beck L, Blood groups and red cell antigens. .
Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is the founding member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulator proteins encoded by the BCL2 gene.
Bcl-2 derives its name from B-cell lymphoma 2, as it is the second member of a range of proteins initially described in chromosomal translocations involving chromosomes 14 and 18 in follicular lymphomas.
Bcl-2 orthologs have been identified in numerous mammals for which complete genome data are available.
The two isoforms of Bcl-2, Isoform 1, also known as 1G5M, and Isoform 2, also known as 1G5O/1GJH, exhibit similar fold.
However, results in the ability of these isoforms to bind to the BAD and BAK proteins, as well as in the structural topology and electrostatic potential of the binding groove, suggest differences in antiapoptotic activity for the two isoforms.
The Bcl-2 gene has been implicated in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, prostate, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and lung carcinomas, as well as schizophrenia and autoimmunity.
It is also thought to be involved in resistance to conventional cancer treatment.
This suggests that decreased apoptosis may play a role in the development of cancer.
Antibodies to Bcl-2 can be used with immunohistochemistry to identify cells containing the antigen.
In healthy tissue, these antibodies will react with B-cells in the mantle zone, as well as some T-cells.
However, there is a considerable increase in positive cells in follicular lymphoma, as well as many other forms of cancer.
In some cases, the presence or absence of Bcl-2 staining in biopsies may be significant for the patient's prognosis or likelihood of relapse.
Measurement of corneal curvature/power can be performed with a variety of instruments, most commonly a keratometer, IOLMaster (a non-contact optical device manufactured by ZEISS), or corneal topography device.
Corneal curvature is usually used for intra-ocular lens (IOL) calculations and corneal refractive surgery.
It is also helpful for contact lens fitting and detecting irregular astigmatism.
Palatinase (also called sucrase-isomaltase) is a brush-border disaccharidase enzyme that hydrolyzes palatinose.
Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a genetic condition affecting the digestion of some sugars.
People with this condition cannot break down the sugars sucrose and maltose.
CSID is also known as genetic sucrase deficiency, SI Deficiency, Disaccharide Intolerance I, and Congenital Sucrose Intolerance.
CSID usually becomes apparent after the infant begins to eat fruits, juices, and grains.
Symptoms include stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and diarrhea.
These digestive problems can lead to failure to thrive and malnutrition.
CSID is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the SI gene.
Treatment focuses on dietary management through a low-sucrose or sucrose-free diet.
In addition, a low-starch or starch-free diet is advised in some cases, especially in the first few years of life.
High density lipoprotein (HDL) is the smallest and densest of the five main lipoproteins which, in addition to HDL, include chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein.
HDL has long been hailed as the 'good' cholesterol because it is able to remove cholesterol from arterial walls and deposit it in the liver.
However, it has been found that measuring the level of HDL in the circulation does not provide an accurate risk assessment of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD).
There are five subclasses of HDL including pre beta-1, small alpha-4, medium alpha-3, large alpha-2 and very large alpha-1.
High concentrations of the largest alpha-1 HDL provides the highest negative predictor for CVD.Measuring these subclasses gives a more precise risk evaluation for CVD than just the level of HDL.
The optimal combination of HDL subclasses for low CVD risk is a high alph-1 and low alpha-4 and pre-beta.
Increased levels of alpha-3 are associated with an increased risk of CVD.
Hev b 6.02, hevein, is a small protein, which has been identified as the most common allergen for healthcare workers allergic to Latex.

As a major allergen for patients sensitized to pollen of Salsola kali but not Chenopodium album (3), Sal k 1 can be considered an allergenic marker to discriminate among patients allergic to Chenopodiaceae pollens.
nSal k 1 can thus be used as a marker of saltwort sensitization for specific immunotherapy (SIT).
The high-affinity IgE receptor, also known as FcÎµRI, or Fc epsilon RI, is the high-affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody isotype involved in the allergy disorder and parasites immunity.
FcÎµRI is a tetrameric receptor complex consisting of one alpha (FcÎµRIÎ± - antibody binding site), one beta (FcÎµRIÎ² - which amplifies the downstream signal), and two disulfide bridge connected gamma chains (FcÎµRIÎ³ - the site where the downstream signal initiates).
It is constitutively expressed on mast cells and basophils and is inducible in eosinophils.
FcÎµRI is found on epidermal Langerhans cells, eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils.
As a result of its cellular distribution, this receptor plays a major role in controlling allergic responses.
FcÎµRI is also expressed on antigen-presenting cells, and controls the production of important immune mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) that promote inflammation.
The most famous mediator is histamine, which results in the five symptoms of inflammation: heat, swelling, pain, redness and itchiness.
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract.
In the central nervous system, serotonin is believed to play an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, emesis (vomiting), sexuality and appetite.
Low levels of Serotonin have been associated with several disorders, notably depression, migraine, bipolar disorder and anxiety.
Isolated and named in 1948 by Maurice M. Rapport, the name serotonin is something of a misnomer and reflects the circumstances of the compound's discovery.
It was initially identified as a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum hence serotonin, a serum agent affecting vascular tone.
This agent was later chemically identified as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) by Rapport, and, as the broad range of physiological roles were elucidated, 5-HT became the preferred name in the pharmacological field.
Loa loa is the filarial nematode (roundworm) species that causes Loa loa filariasis.
It is commonly known as the "eye worm".
Its geographic distribution includes Africa and Sudan.
L. loa is one of four parasitic filarial nematodes that cause subcutaneous filariasis in humans.
The three other filarial nematodes are Mansonella streptocerca, Onchocerca volvulus (causes river blindness), and Dracunculus medinensis (guinea worm).
Maturing larvae and adults of the "eye worm" occupy the subcutaneous layer of the skin - the fat layer - of humans, causing disease.
The young larvae develop in horseflies of the genus Chrysops (deer flies, yellow flies), including the species C. dimidiata and C. silacea, which infect humans by biting them.
Caution: this is not the same as alpha lipoprotein.
Recombinant Malus domestica (rMal d) 3 is a lipid transfer protein of the apple.
Lipid transfer proteins are also present in many other species of plants, including peaches, nuts and grapes, are often linked to severe allergic reactions, and have cross-reactivity across species.
The soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a product of the urokinase plasminogen activator/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor system, which is an important regulator of inflammation, immunity, and coagulopathy.

Cell cycle progression is regulated by cyclins and their cognate cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks).
P27 (Kip1) is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.
P27 binds to and inhibits cyclinE-Cdk2, cyclinA-CDK2 and cyclinD1-CDK4 complex and enforce the G1 restriction point.
It is a candidate tumor suppressor gene, and has been proposed to function as a possible mediator of TGF beta induced G1 arrest.
P27 is up regulated in quiescent cells and in cells treated with cAMP and antimitogenic stimuli.
P27 is regulated by phosphorylation on serine 10 (S10) and threonine 187 (T187).
Phosphorylation by CDK2 on T187 results in ubiquitylation and degradation of p27; while phosphorylation by hKIS on S10 signals the nuclear export to the cytoplasm.
The HADHB gene (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein), beta subunit) is located on chromosome 2p23.
This gene encodes the beta subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, which catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids.
The mitochondrial membrane-bound heterocomplex is composed of four alpha and four beta subunits, with the beta subunit catalyzing the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity.
The encoded protein can also bind RNA and decreases the stability of some mRNAs.
The genes of the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein are located adjacent to each other in the human genome in a head-to-head orientation.
Mutations in this gene result in trifunctional protein deficiency.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis was discovered by Robert Koch in 1882 to be the infectious organism of tuberculosis (TB).
Tuberculosis is a worldwide public health problem, especially in third world countries.
The infection is classified as latent when the patient is asymptomatic and the infection is in a non-transmissible state.
The active form of TB is transmissible and can be diagnosed by culturing the organism or by using molecular testing.
Patients who are symptomatic have symptoms including fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, persistent cough, and hemoptysis.
Treatment of TB has been complicated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains which are present all over the world.
Resistance to all of the drugs used to treat TB has occurred including the first line of treatment drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.
Some strains of TB have become resistant to more than one of the drugs used to treat TB, and are referred to as either multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
MDR-TB are defined to be resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.
XDR-TB have worse disease symptoms and are resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, any one of the fluoroquinolones, and any one of the three injectable second-line drugs amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin.
The biggest risk factor for acquiring TB is to be infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Twenty-five percent of all TB infections occur in patients also infected with HIV, and most of those occur in Africa.
Social and behavioral determinants such as excessive alcohol use, smoking, and type 2 diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of contracting TB by two to three times.
Coliform bacteria are a commonly-used indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water.
Coliform bacteria are defined as rod-shaped gram-negative organisms which ferment lactose with the production of gas when incubated at 35 Â°C.
Coliforms are abundant in the feces of warm-blooded animals, but can also be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation.
In most instances, coliforms themselves are not the cause of sickness, but they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present.
Carnosine (beta -alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide of the amino acids beta -alanine and histidine.
It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues.
Studies have shown that it can be used as an effective dietary supplement for people with autism, potentially improving such areas as auditory processing, speech language skills, motor skills, and socialization.
However, supplemental carnosine may increase corticosterone levels, which can explain the hyperactivity sometimes seen in high doses.
Researchers in Australia, Britain, and Russia have also shown that carnosine has a number of antioxidant properties that may be beneficial.
Carnosine has been proven to scavenge ROS (radical oxygen species) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of cell membrane fatty acids during oxidative stress.
It can oppose glycation and it can chelate divalent metal ions.

Pasteurisation kills M. bovis bacteria in infected milk.
The BRCA1 gene (breast cancer 1, early onset) is located on chromosome 17q21.
This gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor.
The encoded protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC).
This gene product associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes.
This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination.
Mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers.
Alternative splicing plays a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of this gene.

Veterinary Medicine: Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is a subgroup of the herpesviruses that causes inclusion body rhinitis (IBR).
IBR causes a constellation of symptom mainly in nursing or newly weaned piglets that include rhinitis, conjunctivitis, sneezing, nasal discharge, respiratory distress, shivering, and mouth breathing.
Pregnant sows that become infected with PCMV are at risk of delivering a dead, mummified, stillborn, or weak piglet.
PCMV can be found all over the world in pigs of all ages.
The virus is transmitted when virus in nasal and ocular secretions, urine, and infected aerosols created by sneezing and coughing are inhaled or ingested.
Infection is usually asymptomatic when a herd immunity against PCMV is present or when the pigs are six weeks or older in age.
PCMV invades several types of epithelial cells and forms intranuclear inclusion bodies that are visible microscopically when stained.
Diagnosis of PCMV infection is most often made by viewing the intranuclear bodies in tissue samples of symptomatic pigs.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or indirect immunofluorescent assay (IF).
No known effective treatment or medication is available.
The ability of PCMV to infect humans has not been established.
The Interleukins belong to the family termed cytokines.
They are peptides used by immune and inflammatory cells to communicate and control cell operations.

Levels are stimulated by liposaccharide, endotoxins, inflammatory agents, lectin, Tumor Necrosis Factor, and Interferons.
Levels are suppressed by Corticosteroids, Prostaglandin E2, and suppressant lymphocytes
The CDKN1B gene (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27, Kip1)) is located on chromosome 12p13.1-p12.
This gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which shares a limited similarity with CDK inhibitor CDKN1A/p21.
The encoded protein binds to and prevents the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin D-CDK4 complexes, and thus controls the cell cycle progression at G1.
The degradation of this protein, which is triggered by its CDK dependent phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination by SCF complexes, is required for the cellular transition from quiescence to the proliferative state.
Mutations in this gene are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IV (MEN4).

CD8 (cluster of differentiation 8) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receptor for the T cell receptor (TCR).
Like the TCR, CD8 binds to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, but is specific for the class I MHC protein.
It is predominantly expressed on the surface of cytotoxic T cells, but can also be found on natural killer cells.
To function, CD8 forms a dimer, consisting of a pair of CD8 chains.
The most common form of CD8 is composed of a CD8-Î± and CD8-Î² chain, both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily with an immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like extracellular domain connected to the membrane by a thin stalk, and an intracellular tail.
Less-common homodimers of the CD8-Î± chain are also expressed on some cells.
The extracellular IgV-like domain of CD8-Î± interacts with to the Î±3 portion of the Class I MHC molecule.
This affinity keeps the T cell receptor of the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation.
Cytotoxic T cells with CD8 surface protein are called CD8+ T cells.
Hemoglobin C (abbreviated as Hb C or HbC) is an abnormal hemoglobin with substitution of a glutamic acid residue for a lysine residue at the 6th position of the Î²-globin chain.
This mutated form reduces the normal plasticity of host erythrocytes causing a hemoglobinopathy.
In those who are heterozygous for the mutation, about 28-44% of total hemoglobin (Hb) is HbC, and no anemia develops.
In homozygotes, nearly all Hb is in the HbC form, resulting in mild hemolytic anemia.
Target cells, microspherocytes and HbC crystals are found in a blood smear from a homozygous patient.
CD106, is a vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, also known as VCAM1, is a human gene.
This gene is a member of the Ig superfamily and encodes a cell surface sialoglycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated endothelium.
This type I membrane protein mediates leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and signal transduction, and may play a role in the development of artherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
Complex chromosome structural alterations can be detected by using cytogenetic methods such as chromosome painting analysis.
Spectral karyotyping (SKY) and multiplex (M)-FISH are two types of chromosome painting methods.
Both involve "painting" each chromosome a different color using 24 unique fluorochromes and then using the colors to identify subtle structural variations that previously could not be detected.
According to one study, M-FISH has been able to identify chromosome abnormalities in up to 7% of patients with previously unexplained mental retardation.
Complex structural aberration analysis can be the next step in evaluation when an abnormality is detected but cannot be further identified using more common methods, and the advanced methodologies are being utilized in different domains, including prenatal diagnosis as well as solid and hematologic malignancies.
Fencamfamine (Glucoenergan, Reactivan) is a stimulant which was developed in the 1960s as an appetite suppressant, but was later withdrawn for this application due to problems with dependence and abuse.
It is around half the potency of dextroamphetamine, and is prescribed at a dose of 10-60mg, although abusers of the drug tend to rapidly develop tolerance and escalate their dose.
Reactivan is still used, though rarely, for treating depressive day-time fatigue, lack of concentration and lethargy, particularly in individuals who have chronic medical conditions, as its favourable safety profile makes it the most suitable drug in some cases.
Fencamfamine acts as an indirect dopamine agonist.
It releases dopamine by a similar mechanism to amphetamines, but is ten times less potent than dexamphetamine at producing this effect.
The main mechanism of action is instead inhibition of dopamine reuptake, more similar to that of methylphenidate.
Also unlike amphetamines, fencamfamine does not inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase enzymes and so is somewhat safer.
Some experiments also suggest a role for opioid receptors in the activity of fencamfamine, as low doses can cause paradoxical sedation, and some effects of the drug are blocked by naloxone.
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament (IF) protein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), almost exclusively in astrocytes, as well as in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
GFAP is used as a biomarker for traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and stroke.
In the presence of astrogliosis, GFAP gene activation and protein production are found to be increased.
Additionally, studies have found that an increased amount of GFAP is found in serum following TBIs and stroke.
The hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia (HIL) indices measure the amount of interference in a specimen due to hemolysis, bilirubin, and lipids, respectively.
All three are measured by assessing a sample's light absorbance at different wavelengths.
Different IVD manufacturers use different wavelengths to measure each one.
There is some overlap between the wavelengths at which each one is detected, and each manufacturer accounts for this when determining which wavelengths to utilize for each.
The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommends using cutoff values for acceptable HIL levels that are specific to the analyte being measured, since HIL levels may impact the measurement of different analytes to different degrees.
Alpha hydroxytriazolam is one of two major metabolites of Triazolam.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), originally named corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and also called corticoliberin, is a polypeptide hormone and neurotransmitter involved in the stress response.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a 41-amino acid peptide derived from a 191-amino acid preprohormone.
CRH is secreted by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in response to stress.
Marked reduction in CRH has been observed in association with Alzheimer's disease, and autosomal recessive hypothalamic corticotropin deficiency has multiple and potentially-fatal metabolic consequences including hypoglycemia and hepatitis.
In addition to being produced in the hypothalamus, CRH is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, such as T lymphocytes, and is highly expressed in the placenta.
In the placenta, CRH is a marker that determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery.
A rapid increase in circulating levels of CRH occurs at the onset of parturition, suggesting that, in addition to its metabolic functions, CRH may act as a trigger for parturition.

Another metabolite, 3alpha, 5beta-tetrahydroaldosterone (TH-Aldo), reflects 15-40% of aldosterone excretion and usually provides a more accurate index of aldosterone secretion.
Determination of both metabolites in urine increases the diagnostic accuracy for primary aldosteronism.
Rho(D) Immune Globulin is a medicine given by intramuscular injection which is used to prevent the immunological condition known as Rhesus disease (or hemolytic disease of newborn).
The medicine is a solution of IgG anti-D (anti-RhD) antibodies which bind to, and lead to the destruction of, fetal Rh D positive red blood cells that have passed from the fetal circulation to the maternal circulation.
Therefore, in a Rhesus negative mother it can prevent sensitization of the maternal immune system to Rh D antigens, which can cause rhesus disease in the current or in subsequent pregnancies.
With the widespread use of Rho(D) Immune Globulin, Rh disease of the fetus and newborn has almost disappeared.
It can also be used in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in Rhesus positive patients.
Dwell time is the length of time the peritoneal dialysis solution stays in the peritoneal cavity before it is drained.

An arthropod is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages.
Aerobic exercise and fitness can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise, of which strength training and short-distance running are the most salient examples.
The two types of exercise differ by the duration and intensity of muscular contractions involved, as well as by how energy is generated within the muscle.
In most conditions, anaerobic exercise is accompanied by aerobic exercises because the less efficient anaerobic metabolism must supplement the aerobic system due to energy demands that exceed the aerobic system's capacity.
What is generally called aerobic exercise might be better termed "solely aerobic", because it is designed to be low-intensity enough not to generate lactate via pyruvate fermentation, so that all carbohydrate is aerobically turned into energy.

The infecting agent or prion is a mal-formed version (PrPsc) of a normal protein (PrP) found in all animals.
The malformation of the normal prion proteins occurs when they are exposed to the mal-formed version of the protein.
The normal prion proteins may be more or less susceptible to malformation when they are exposed to the mal-formed protein based on their genetic makeup.
Resistance or susceptibility has been linked to the presence of certain amino acids at various locations within the normal protein.
Genotyping determines the amino acids present at specific locations or codons in the prion protein.
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant animals for breeding and eradication.
Codons associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie include codon 112, 136, 141, 154 and 171.
Codon 141 codes for either phenylalanine (F) or leucine (L).
The presence of F at codon 141 has been associated with increased susceptibility to Nor98 or an atypical form of scrapie.
Benperidol is a butyrophenone antipsychotic drug with a high neuroleptic potency.
It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia, to control anti-social hypersexual behavior, and sometimes prescribed to sex offenders as a condition of their parole.

Flavivirus is a genus of the family Flaviviridae that includes the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis.
Flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus, the type virus for the family; flavus means yellow in Latin.
Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims.
Flaviviruses share a common size (40-65 nm), symmetry (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), nucleic acid (positive-sense, single stranded RNA approximately 10,000-11,000 bases), and appearance in the electron microscope.
These viruses are transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick).
Human infections with these viruses are typically incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titres to reinfect arthropods and thus continue the virus life cycle.
The exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses, which still require mosquito vectors, but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although both continue have important animal transmission routes as well).
Other virus transmission routes include handling infected animal carcasses, blood transfusion, child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products.
The transmission from animals to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod is thought to be unlikely.
For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious.

HLA Bw4 and Bw6 epitopes were the the original HLA B distinctions recognized serologically.
Since they represent epitopes shared by a number of different HLA antigens, they are called "public" epitopes, and could be considered supertypes.
Either the Bw4 or the Bw6 epitope is expressed by virtually all HLA-B molecules, whereas Bw4 also is found on a few HLA-A proteins.
The PTPN11 gene (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11) is located on chromosome 12q24.
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family.
PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation.
This PTP contains two tandem Src homology-2 domains, which function as phospho-tyrosine binding domains and mediate the interaction of this PTP with its substrates.
This PTP is widely expressed in most tissues and plays a regulatory role in various cell signaling events that are important for a diversity of cell functions, such as mitogenic activation, metabolic control, transcription regulation, and cell migration.
Mutations in this gene are a cause of Noonan syndrome as well as acute myeloid leukemia.
Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Alpha-hydroxyalprazolam is a metabolite of both alprazolam and adinazolam.
Alprazolam (trade name Xanax) is an anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine class of psychoactive drugs.
Alprazolam binds to specific sites on the GABAA gamma-amino-butyric acid receptor.
Adinazolam (brand name Deracyn) is a benzodiazepine derivative possessing anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties.
Alpha-hydroxyalprazolam belongs to the family of benzodiazepines.
Chloroethane or monochloroethane, commonly known by its old name ethyl chloride, is a chemical compound with chemical formula C2H5Cl, once widely used in producing tetra-ethyl lead, a gasoline additive.
It is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet odor.
Ethyl chloride is the least toxic of the chloroethanes.
Like other chlorinated hydrocarbons, it is a central nervous system depressant, albeit a less potent one than many similar compounds.
People breathing its vapors at less than 1% concentration in air usually experience no symptoms.
At higher concentrations, victims usually exhibit symptoms similar to those of alcohol intoxication.
Breathing its vapors at 15% or higher is often fatal.
Studies on the effects of chronic ethyl chloride exposure in animals have given inconsistent results, and there exist no data for its long-term effects on humans.
Some studies have reported that prolonged exposure can produce liver or kidney damage, or uterine cancer in mice, but these data have been difficult to reproduce.
Chloroethane is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).
Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide and nicotinic acid amide, is the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3).
Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B group.
Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is converted to niacinamide in vivo, and though the two are identical in their vitamin functions, niacinamide does not have the same pharmacologic and toxic effects of niacin, which occur incidental to niacin's conversion.
Thus niacinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing, although nicotinamide may be toxic to the liver at doses exceeding 3 g/day for adults.
In cells, niacin is incorporated into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), although the pathways for nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are very similar.
NAD+ and NADP+ are coenzymes in a wide variety of enzymatic oxidation-reduction reactions.
Serratia marcescens is an important cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract and bloodstream infections.
The gyrB gene is conserved among strains of S Marcescens, and therefore, the presence of the gene in clinical specimens can be used to identify this organism as one of the pathogens responsible for a specific infection.
Plasma cells are fully differentiated B lymphocytes that produce and secrete a specific antibody.
Plasma cells typically produce a mixture of kappa and lambda light chains, but monotypic (or monoclonal) plasma cells produce either elevated kappa or lambda light chains.
Monotypic plasma cells are characteristic of disorders such as leukemia and multiple myeloma.
The use of multi-parameter flow cytometry makes it possible to analyze large numbers of cells that distinguish intracellular antigens.
Not only does such technology improve the diagnosis of monotypic populations, but it also is important for monitoring treatment and demonstrating smoldering disease.
Rhizopus nigricans is a fungus commonly known as bread mold and is the most common species of Rhizopus.
It is found on old food and in soils and even in children's sandboxes.
The genus contains some 50 species and bread mold is sometimes confused with species of Mucor or other species of Rhizopus like Rhizopus oryzae.
The spores, dispersed in hot dry weather, contain allergenic proteins with 31 distinct allergens, which can produce respiratory and nasal symptoms in concentration (chronic cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, chronic phlegm, snuffle, snizzle and allergic rhinitis).
Food handling workers are particularly at risk if they are mold allergic.
The AR gene (androgen receptor) is located on chromosome Xq12.
The androgen receptor gene is more than 90 kb long and codes for a protein that has 3 major functional domains: the N-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain, and androgen-binding domain.
The protein functions as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor.
Upon binding the hormone ligand, the receptor dissociates from accessory proteins, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes, and then stimulates transcription of androgen responsive genes.
This gene contains 2 polymorphic trinucleotide repeat segments that encode polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts in the N-terminal transactivation domain of its protein.
Expansion of the polyglutamine tract causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease).
Mutations in this gene are also associated with complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS).
Two alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.
The CDKN1C gene (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C) is located on chromosome 11p15.4.
This gene is imprinted, with preferential expression of the maternal allele.
The encoded protein is a tight-binding, strong inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes and a negative regulator of cell proliferation.
Mutations in this gene are implicated in sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndorome, suggesting that this gene is a tumor suppressor candidate.
Three transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Acute kidney injury (AKI), formerly known as acute renal failure, describes the rapid loss of the kidney's ability to excrete urine.
Decreased urine output, elevated blood levels of the nitrogen metabolic products urea nitrogen and creatinine, and the accumulation in the blood of metabolic acids including potassium and phosphates, are symptoms of and factors used to diagnose AKI.
The incidence of AKI is especially high in critically ill patients who often have comorbidities.
Treatment is only supportive.
The discovery of biomarkers related to AKI have sparked hope that AKI, including insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), may help with earlier diagnosis of AKI.
Cefoxitin is a second generation Cephalosporin.
Less active against staphylococci and streptococci than first generation cephalosporins, but active against anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis; active against gram-negative enteric bacilli including E. coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus; used predominantly for respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, urinary tract and gynecologic as well as septicemia; surgical prophylaxis; intra-abdominal infections and other mixed infections; indicated for bacterial Eikenella corrodens infections.

BUNV is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus.
BUNV belongs to the family Peribunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus.
The vectors are mosquitoes including Aedes and Ae.
The virus causes disease in livestock animals, avian species, and humans.
BUNV generally produces mild symptoms including fever, headache, joint pain, and rash, but in some cases causes severe encephalitis .
Hippuric acid is biological renal marker used to monitor exposure to toluene or benzyl alchonol.
Hippuric acid and methyl hippuric acid are the principal metabolities of toluene and xylene, respectively.
Occupational exposure to these chemicals can be monitored by measuring urinary metabolite excretion.
Typical excretion of hippuric acid in non-exposed patients is 1.0 g/g creatinine.
Methyl hippuric acid is not found in non-exposed patients.
Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that arises during methionine metabolism.
Although its concentration in plasma is only about 10 micromolar (uM), even moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease.
Elevations in plasma homocysteine are commonly found as a result of vitamin deficiencies, polymorphisms of enzymes of methionine metabolism, and renal disease.
Pyridoxal, folic acid, riboflavin, and Vitamin B(12) are all required for methionine metabolism, and deficiency of each of these vitamins result in elevated plasma homocysteine.
A polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (C677T), which is quite common in most populations with a homozygosity rate of 10-15 %, is associated with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, especially in the context of marginal folate intake.
Plasma homocysteine is inversely related to plasma creatinine in patients with renal disease.
This is due to an impairment in homocysteine removal in renal disease.
The role of these factors, and of modifiable lifestyle factors, in affecting methionine metabolism and in determining plasma homocysteine levels is discussed.
Homocysteine is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor modifiable by nutrition and possibly exercise.
Homocysteine was first identified as an important biological compound in 1932 and linked with human disease in 1962 when elevated urinary homocysteine levels were found in children with mental retardation.
This condition, called homocysteinuria, was later associated with premature occlusive CVD, even in children.
These observations led to research investigating the relationship of elevated homocysteine levels and CVD in a wide variety of populations including middle age and elderly men and women with and without traditional risk factors for CVD. ,
The fetus's risk of having trisomy 18 can be estimated based on maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness, and maternal serum or plasma levels for free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A).
Reliable risk calculations for trisomy 18 and other trisomies (13, 21) in first-trimester screening depends on good estimates of the medians for fetal NT thickness, free beta-hCG, and PAPP-A from unaffected pregnancies.
Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome 18 in each cell rather than two.
Edwards syndrome is associated with intrauterine growth retardation and fetal demise, and liveborn infants with Edwards syndrome typically have low birth weight, congenital heart disease, and characteristic physical features.
Less than 10% of liveborn infants with Edwards syndrome live past their first year.
The general population risk of Edwards syndrome is 1 out of 5,000 live births, and the risk for Edwards syndrome increases with increasing maternal age.

Carbohydrate deficient transferrin detects chronic ethanol use (greater than 50 g/day for two weeks).
Transferrin is a plasma protein that carries iron through the bloodstream to the bone marrow, where red blood cells are manufactured, as well as to the liver and spleen.
Structurally, transferrin is a polypeptide with two N-linked polysaccharide chains.
These polysaccharide chains are branched with sialic acid residues.
Sialic acid is a monosaccharide carbohydrate.
Various forms of transferrin exist, with differing levels of sialylation, with the most common form being tetrasialotransferrin, with four sialic acid chains.
In people who consume significant quantities of alcohol (usually more than 4 or 5 alcoholic beverages a day for two weeks or more), the proportion of transferrin with zero, one, or two sialic acid chains is increased.
These are referred to as carbohydrate-deficient transferrins, and are an important marker for alcohol abuse.
Used with other tests, such as gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), carbohydrate-deficient transferrin can be a useful tool in identifying problem drinking, such as alcohol abuse or alcoholism.
This particular test is not suitable for the evaluation of patients suspected of having congenital glycosylation disorders.

The prothrombin time (PT) and its derived measures of prothrombin ratio (PR) and international normalized ratio (INR) are measures of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.
They are used to determine the clotting tendency of blood, in the measure of warfarin dosage, liver damage and vitamin K status.
The reference range for prothrombin time is usually around 12-15 seconds; the normal range for the INR is 0.8-1.2.
It is used in conjunction with the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) which measures the intrinsic pathway.
PT is sometimes used as the third screening test in the lupus anticoagulant testing algorithm and is included in the LOINC LA aPTT & dRVVT & PT panel.

Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic derivative of lincomycin active against most gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria.
Clindamycin together with pyrimethamine has been used as alternative treatment for toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS patients.
Solerol is a volatile component identified in extracts of grape wines and numerous fruits, with aroma being among the most important factors in determining wine character and quality.. Solerol (4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid lactone) also appears to be a marker for Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency and probably arises from the reaction of succinic semialdehyde with an intermediate in the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway.
SSADH is a defect in gamma-aminobutyric acid catabolism, resulting in the accumulation of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and causing neurological and cognitive disorders of varying severity.
The complement system is a key part of the immune system and inflammatory response.
The system has three pathways: 1) the classic pathway, 2) the alternative pathway, and 3) the lectin activation pathway.
Complement C7 is involved in the alternate complement pathway and one of the late activation complement proteins along with C5, C6, C8, and C9.
Patients with deficiencies of the late complement proteins are unable to form the membrane attack complex (MAC), the end result of the complement activation cascade.
Patients with C7 deficiency have increased susceptibility to neisserial infections and some have developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), scleroderma, and pyoderma gangrenosum.
Complement tests measure either the quantity or the activity (function) of complement proteins.
In some cases, complement proteins are present but not functional, in which case a functional assay is used to detect the deficiency.

The SFTPB gene (surfactant protein B) is located on chromosome 2p12-p11.2.
This gene encodes the pulmonary-associated surfactant protein B (SPB), an amphipathic surfactant protein essential for lung function and homeostasis after birth.
Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex composed of 90% lipids and 10% proteins which include plasma proteins and apolipoproteins SPA, SPB, SPC and SPD.
The surfactant is secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung and maintains the stability of pulmonary tissue by reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the lung.
The SPB enhances the rate of spreading and increases the stability of surfactant monolayers in vitro.
Multiple mutations in this gene have been identified, which cause pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 1, also called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis due to surfactant protein B deficiency, and are associated with fatal respiratory distress in the neonatal period.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified.
Fumarase deficiency is characterized by polyhydramnios and fetal brain abnormalities.
In the newborn period, findings include severe neurologic abnormalities, poor feeding, failure to thrive, and hypotonia.
Mutations in the production and development of fumarase have led to the discovery of several fumarase-related diseases in humans.
These include benign mesenchymal tumors of the uterus, leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and fumarase deficiency.
Germinal mutations in fumarase are associated with two distinct conditions.
If the enzyme has missense mutation and in-frame deletions from the 3' end, fumarase deficiency results.
If it contains heterozygous 5' missense mutation and deletions (ranging from one base pair to the whole gene), then leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma/
Reed's syndrome (multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis) could result.
Cefetamet is a cephalosporin antibiotic.

Drug resistance reports assist with treatment decisions.
Aspergillus, the mold (a type of fungus) that causes aspergillosis, is very common both indoors and outdoors, and for people who have weakened immune systems, breathing in Aspergillus spores can cause an infection in the lungs or sinuses which can spread to other parts of the body.
There are approximately 180 species of Aspergillus, but fewer than 40 of them are known to cause infections in humans.
Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of human Aspergillus infections.
Other common species include A. flavus, A. terreus, and A. niger.
Teichoic acids are bacterial polysaccharides of glycerol phosphate or ribitol phosphate linked via phosphodiester bonds.
Lysis of Gram-positive bacteria and release of the teichoic acid into the bloodstream may cause fever, blood vessel dilation and possibly shock and subsequent death.
Teichoic acid can also be used by bacteria to attach to mucosal membranes.
Given their appearance in pyelonephritis, these should be seen in association with loose bacteria, white blood cells, and white blood cell casts.
Their discovery is likely rare, due to the infection-fighting efficiency of neutrophils, and the possibility of misidentification as a fine granular cast.

In LOINC, sex refers to the biological sex of an organism, which is most commonly determined based on anatomy and physiology or genetic (chromosome) analysis.
Our definition is based on the World Health Organization's definition of sex and gender: sex (male, female) refers to biological and physiological characteristics, and gender (masculine, feminine) refers to socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes.
Zopiclone-N-oxide is one of two metabolites of eszopiclone and is not pharmacologically active.
Eszopiclone is a cyclopyrrolones and a benzodiazepine receptor agonist derived from pyridine, pyrazine and piperazine and used to treat insomnia.
Its mechanism of action is to bind to the omega-1 subtype of the alpha subunit of gamma-aminobutyrate-benzodiazepine GABA receptor complex (GABA-A).
GABA-A is a chloride ionophore in the central nervous system, that when bound causes the chloride channels to open, leading to hyperpolarization, inhibition of neuronal firing, and an increase in the inhibition of GABA.
This sequence of events causes an hypnotic response in the patient and induces sleep.
Eszopiclone has insignificant anxiolytic activity and shows no evidence of causing increased liver enzymes in the blood.
A species of gram-negative bacteria causing contagious agalactia of SHEEP and GOATS.
The KIF6 gene encodes kinesin-like protein 6, which is part of a superfamily of motor proteins that play a role in intracellular transport.
Although KIF6 is not directly related to lipid metabolism, there is an association between KIF6 variants and increased risk for coronary heart disease.
One such variant is c.2155T>C (p.Trp719Arg; rs20455), which may also play a role in individual patient responses to statin therapy.
Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid), is a water-soluble vitamin naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
Humans, unlike most animals, cannot synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component.
Vitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, certain neurotransmitters, and involved in protein metabolism.
Vitamin C is also an important physiological antioxidant and has been shown to regenerate other antioxidants, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E).
Insufficient vitamin C intake causes scurvy.
Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C. Citrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of vitamin C. Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe.
The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking because ascorbic acid is water soluble and destroyed by heat.
MyoD is a protein with a key role in regulating muscle differentiation.
MyoD belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs).
These bHLH (basic helix loop helix) transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation.
MRF family members include MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6).
MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment.
MyoD is expressed in activated satellite cells, but not in quiescent satellite cells.
Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene.
This is likely to be due to functional redundancy from Myf5.
A liver fibrosis score is a noninvasive method used to determine the presence and degree of liver fibrosis in a patient based on a variety of different parameters (e.g., lab tests, age, and gender) depending on the method used..
Different methods used to calculate a patient's liver fibrosis score include the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score, HepaScore, FibroMeter, and FibroSURE.

Organophosphate pesticides are commonly used insecticides in agriculture and public health applications.
Although organophosphates are beneficial for killing a broad variety of insects, human overexposure to this pesticide can cause neurological dysfunction and excess acetylcholine in both the peripheral and central nervous system.
Overexposure to an organophosphate pesticide is typically caused by inhalation, dermal contact, or ingestion of contaminated foods.
Once in the human body, 75% of the organophosphorous pesticide is metabolized into dialkyl phosphorous.
Urinary dialkyl phosphorous metabolite levels can be monitored to determine recent exposure to organophosphate pesticides.
The nucleus of a cell contains the body's genetic material.
It is the site of transcriptional regulation, RNA processing and DNA synthesis and transcription.
Clonidine is a direct-acting adrenergic agonist prescribed historically as an anti-hypertensive agent.
It has found new uses, including treatment of some types of neuropathic pain, opioid detoxification, and, off-label, to counter the side effects of stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or Adderall.
It is becoming a more accepted treatment for insomnia, because clonidine is less addictive than most prescription sleep aids.
Clonidine is increasingly used in conjunction with stimulants to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where it's given in late afternoon andor evening for sleep, and because it sometimes helps moderate ADHD-associated impulsive and oppositional behavior, and may reduce tics.
Clonidine can also be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome.

Thymine is one of the four nucleobases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G-C-A-T.
The others are adenine, guanine, and cytosine.
Thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil, a pyrimidine nucleobase.
As the name suggests, thymine may be derived by methylation of uracil at the 5th carbon.
In RNA, thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases.
In DNA, thymine(T) binds to adenine (A) via two hydrogen bonds, thus stabilizing the nucleic acid structures.
Thymine combined with deoxyribose creates the nucleoside deoxythymidine, which is synonymous with the term thymidine.
Thymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two, or three phosphoric acid groups, creating, respectively, TMP, TDP, or TTP (thymidine mono-, di-, or triphosphate).
One of the common mutations of DNA involves two adjacent thymines or cytosine, which, in presence of ultraviolet light, may form thymine dimers, causing "kinks" in the DNA molecule that inhibit normal function.
Thymine could also be a target for actions of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cancer treatment.
5-FU can be a metabolic analog of thymine (in DNA synthesis) or uracil (in RNA synthesis).
Substitution of this analog inhibits DNA synthesis in actively-dividing cells.
Thymine bases are frequently oxidized to hydantoins over time after the death of an organism
The terms "Filbert" and "Hazel nut" are often used interchangeably for nuts from all plants in the genus Corylus, such as C. silvestris, C. maxima and C. colurna.

These are the most common ailments attributable to Cockroach infestation of housing and are important public health problems.
Haemophilus influenza is a pleomorphic gram-negative coccobacillus.
H influenzae is divided into six serotype (A-F) based on their capsular polysaccharides.
The majority of haemophilus infections are caused by H influenza serotype B (HIB) which causes pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, epiglottitis, septic arthritis, cellulitis, otitis media, purulent pericarditis, endocarditis and osteomyelitis.
Infections with the remaining serotypes lead to similar disease processes as HIB.
Unencapsulated H influenzae that is not able to be typed (nontypable H influenzae) can cause ear infections in children and bronchitis in adults but also bacteremia and bacteremic pneumonia.
Nontypable H influenza is the main cause of invasive H influenzae infections in all age groups.

The omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are necessary nutrients that cannot be produced in the body.
They are essential to normal brain function and to growth and development.
In addition, omega-6 fatty acids help stimulate skin and hair growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism, and maintain the reproductive system.
The source of omega-6 fatty acids is mainly from vegetable oils including linoleic acid (LA).
LA is converted in the body to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and further broken down to arachidonic acid (AA).
GLA is believed to reduce inflammation and can be found as a supplement in evening primrose oil, borage oil, and black currant seed oil.
The GLA in these supplements is converted to dihomo-y-linolenic acid (DGLA) which has anti-inflammatory properties.
Nutrients that help drive the conversion of GLA to DGLA include magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin B3, and vitamin B6.

Its life cycle includes a lytic and a latent phase.
During the lytic phase the cytoskeleton of the infected cell is disrupted and becomes very large.
The enlarged cell eludes detection by natural killer (NK) cells by encoding UL16.
UL16 is a protein that binds to the ligand NDG2D which is a surface receptor on NK cells and, when blocked, prevents the CMV infected cell from apoptotic signaling to NK cells to destroy it.
In the US one in three children are infected by CMV by the age of five and over half of adults are infected by age 40.
Infection with CMV is mostly asymptomatic.
Symptoms when present include fever, sore throat, fatigue, swollen glands.

Gossypol is a dimeric sesquiterpene isolated from the seed, roots, leaves and stem of the cotton plant (Gossypium sp.).
It exists as both protein-bound and free forms.
The free form of gossypol is toxic.
In the plant, the toxic form is a natural defense against predators, causing infertility in insects.
In animals and man, daily ingestion of gossypol provokes infertility.
In men, it is used as a contraceptive and causes spermatogenesis arrest at relatively low doses.
Veterinary Medicine: Cottonseed meal, a by-product of cotton, is used for animal feeding because it is rich in oil and proteins.
Due to the toxicity of gossypol, cottonseed use is limited in animal feed.
Food and animal agricultural industries must manage cottonseed meal levels to avoid toxicity.
High concentrations of free gossypol most commonly cause impairment of male and female reproduction.
Toxicity can also lead to respiratory distress, impaired body weight gain, anorexia, apathy, and even death after several days.

The degree of mitotic activity in breast carcinoma is one component of the Nottingham histologic grade (NHG), which is a prognostic indicator for patients with breast carcinoma.
The two other components of the NHG are tubule formation and nuclear pleomorphism.
Mitotic activity is assessed as the number of mitoses per 10 high power fields (HPF), with increasing mitotic activity being an indicator of more aggressive cancer.
The specific scores assigned to the number of mitoses depends on the size of the HPF.
For example, for a HPF size of 0.274 mm^2, less than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF gets a score of 1, 10-19 gets a score of 2, and greater than or equal to 20 gets a score of 3.
When larger or smaller HPFs are used, the cutoffs for the number of mitoses corresponding to a specific score are adjusted according to published guidelines.
The Reoviridae (Respiratory Enteritic Orphan virus) are a family of viruses that includes some viruses that affect the gastrointestinal system (such as Rotavirus), and some that cause respiratory infections.
The genetic material of viruses in this family is double-stranded RNA.
The name Reoviridae is derived from respiratory enteric orphan viruses.
The term orphan virus means a virus that is not associated with any known disease.
Even though Reoviridae have been identified with various diseases, the original name is still used.
Reovirus infection occurs often in humans, but most cases are mild or subclinical.
The virus can be readily detected in faeces, and many also be recovered from pharyngeal or nasal secretions, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood.
Despite the ease of finding Reovirus in clinical specimens, their role in human disease or treatment is still uncertain.
Reoviruses have an inner and outer layer to their capsids--a double capsid.

Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBC), comprising about 1% of the red cells in the human body.
They develop and mature in the bone marrow and then circulate for about a day in the blood before developing into mature RBC.
Like mature RBC, reticulocytes do not have a nucleus.
They are called reticulocytes because of a reticular (mesh-like) network of ribosomal RNA that is visible under a microscope.
Reticulocytes appear slightly bluer than other RBC when stained with Romanowsky stain.
Reticulocytes are also slightly larger and thus can be identified as a high mean corpuscular volume during a full blood count done by machine.

In mammals it causes male sterility at high levels of exposure.
Heptachlor epoxide is an organochlorine that is produced when heptachlor is oxidized.
The oxidation process is carried out by many plants and animals, including humans, when they are exposed to heptachlor.
Heptachlor is easily oxidized to heptachlor epoxide when it is exposed to air.
Heptachlor was used to treat insects found in homes, buildings, and on food crops, mainly corn.
Heptachlor is toxic to humans and animals, causing irritability, salivation and dizziness when recurrently inhaled or exposed in and around the mouth.
Heptachlor production gradually ended in the 1980s, but remains in the soil and in hazardous waste sites.
Heptachlor epoxide is more prevalent in the environment than heptachlor.
Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, multilayered, icosahedral viruses composed of an outer layer, an inner layer, and a core.
After the immature, double-layered virus is assembled in the host cell cytoplasm, they bud across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acquire a temporary membrane that has on its surface the ER resident viral glycoproteins NSP4, VP4 and VP7.
The virus loses its temporary membrane and the NSP4 glycoprotein as it moves toward the center of the ER cisternae.
The VP4 and VP7 proteins are pushed to the outermost membrane layer and become the mature triple-layered rotavirus.
The outer capsid glycoprotein VP7 is believed to be important for the attachment to and entry in the host cell.
After it enters the host cell, the VP7 glycoprotein is lost.
When the host cell lyses, the mature virus are released.
There are eight groups of rotavirus, A through H. Groups A, B, C, and H are associated with an acute gastroenteritis and are found in humans and animals.
Groups D, E, F, and G are found only in animals.

Veterinary medicine: Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is among the smallest bacteria in nature and lacks a cell wall.
It is prevalent in swine herds worldwide and causes nominal distress unless present with other bacteria and viruses.
When infection with M hyoopneumoniae occurs in concert with the viruses porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), symptoms become severe and the duration of illness increases.
M hyopneumoniae causes the destruction of cilia and epithelial death by attaching to the epithelial cilia of the lower airways.
M hyopneumoniae eludes the immune system of the pig at the gene level by switching what proteins emerge on its cell surface.
Culture is not recommended to identify M hyopneumoniae due to its slow and fastidious growth.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are available, but have low negative predictive values, which may be due in part to a reduced interaction of the immune system within the airways, where M hyopneumoniae colonizes.
Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) uses two primers to detect M hyopneumoniae and has increased the accuracy of detecting M hyopneumoniae.
Transmission of M hyopneumoniae is by direct contact with nasal secretion or inhalation of aerosols over short distances.
There is an increased incidence of infection with M hyopneumoniae when the pigs are crowded closely together, there is poor air quality, there are fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and when other pathogens are present.

The clinical manifestations of Parovirus B19 infection can vary significantly and range from asymptomatic or minor illness in children, including erythema infectiosium (fifth disease), to varying degrees of arthropathy in adults, to severe disease, including transient aplastic anemia in individuals with hematological disorders and severe fetal anemia which can lead to hydrops fetalis and fetal death.
Although primarily transmitted by the respiratory route, there are many reports in the literature of transmission through plasma products, especially coagulation factors, due to: 1) the size of plasma pools; 2) the incidence of acute, imperceptible infections; 3) high levels of virus in a viremic donation (up to 1012 IU/mL); and 4) resistance to commonly used viral inactivation/removal procedures.

The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) is a qualitative serum test that combines the results of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) by EIA, testing for cancer Ag 125 and the patient's menopausal status into a numerical score.
The ROMA score is intended to aid in assessing whether a premenopausal or postmenopausal woman who presents with an ovarian adnexal mass is at a low or high likelihood of finding malignancy at surgery.
ROMA is indicated for women who meet the following criteria: over age 18; ovarian adnexal mass present for which surgery is planned, and not yet referred to an oncologist.
The ROMA score must be interpreted in conjunction with an independent clinical and radiological assessment.

Thyroid peroxidase is an enzyime that is required in order for iodine to be added to the protein thyroglobulin, a precursor to the generation of thyroid hormones which are important in the physical growth, brain development and metabolism of the body.
If thyroid peroxidase is not produced or blocked by antibodies, hypothyroidism occurs.
Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, muscle weakness, increased cholesterol levels, depression and impaired memory.
Candida tropicalis is a significant species of Candida with regard to its epidemiology and virulence.
It produces a number of virulence factors including biofilm, adhesion to buccal epithelial and endothelial cells, the secretion of lytic enzymes, bud-to-hyphae transition, and phenotypic switching.
In Asia and Latin America, C tropicalis is the second or third most common species of Candida to cause systemic disease.
It is able to survive in high salt concentrations, that is significant for fungal persistence in saline environments.
C tropicalis is resistant to several antifungal drugs currently in use including the azole derivatives, amphotericin B, and the echinocandins.
It exists as a true hyphae and diploid yeast that cannot be distinguished from other Candida species on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA).
It is capable of fermenting galactose, sucrose, maltose, and trehalose.
Phenyltoloxamine is an antihistamine with sedative and analgesic effects.
It is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents and an anticholinergic.
Lymphoblasts are immature cells which typically differentiate to form mature lymphocytes.
Normally lymphoblasts are found in the bone marrow, but in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblasts proliferate uncontrollably and are found in large numbers in the peripheral blood.
Although commonly lymphoblast refers to a precursor cell in the maturation of leukocytes, the usage of this term is sometimes inconsistent.
The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium defines a lymphoblast as "A lymphocyte that has become larger after being stimulated by an antigen.
Lymphoblasts look like immature lymphocytes, and were once thought to be precursor cells.
Commonly, when speaking about leukemia, "blast" is used as an abbreviation for lymphoblasts.
The NEB gene (nebulin) is located on chromosome 2q22.
This gene encodes nebulin, a giant protein component of the cytoskeletal matrix that coexists with the thick and thin filaments within the sarcomeres of skeletal muscle.
In most vertebrates, nebulin accounts for 3 to 4% of the total myofibrillar protein.
The encoded protein contains approximately 30-amino acid long modules that can be classified into 7 types and other repeated modules.
Protein isoform sizes vary from 600 to 800 kD due to alternative splicing that is tissue-, species-,and developmental stage-specific.
Of the 183 exons in the nebulin gene, at least 43 are alternatively spliced, although exons 143 and 144 are not found in the same transcript.
Of the several thousand transcript variants predicted for nebulin, the RefSeq Project has decided to create three representative RefSeq records.
Mutations in this gene are associated with recessive nemaline myopathy.
RNA polymerase III (also called Pol III) transcribes DNA to synthesize ribosomal 5S rRNA, tRNA and other small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs.
Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit.
The genes transcribed by RNA Pol III fall in the category of "housekeeping" genes whose expression is required in all cell types and most environmental conditions.
Therefore the regulation of Pol III transcription is primarily tied to the regulation cell growth and the cell cycle, thus requiring fewer regulatory proteins than RNA polymerase II.

Endrin is a white, solid, nearly odorless chemical that has been used to eradicate insects, rodents, and birds.
It has not been available for sale or use or allowed to be manufactured in the United States since 1986.
Endrin can be found in low levels in ground and surface water where it is mostly bound to the bottom sediment.
It does bioaccumulate in the tissues of aquatic wildlife.
Endrin is detectable in soil after application for as long as 10 years.
Endrin is toxic if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed by the skin.
If burned, endrin can produce toxic hydrogen chloride and phosgene.
Symptoms of endrin poisoning include epileptiform convulsions, stupor, headache, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, aggressiveness, confusion, drowsiness, lassitude, and anorexia.
Endrin is not classified as a human carcinogen.
Retinol binding proteins (RBPs) are a family of carrier proteins that bind retinol.
The term "retinol binding protein" (singular) in the clinical literature commonly refers to the circulating form that transports retinol from the liver to peripheral tissues.
Because RBP4 is extensively reabsorbed by the kidney tubules, very little normally appears in excreted urine.
An increase in the urinary excretion of retinol binding protein indicates impaired proximal tubular function.
This can be caused by renal tubulointerstitial nephritis, tubular toxicity from heavy metal or nephrotoxic drug exposure, glomerulonephropathies and renal vasculopathies .
A propionic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic.
It is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
Visual field testing is a measurement of areas of vision seen both centrally and peripherally while fixating on an object.
Perimetry or campimetry is one way to test the visual field by systematically measuring differential light sensitivity in the visual field by the detection of test targets on a defined background.
Perimetry more carefully maps and quantifies the visual field, especially at the extreme periphery.
Static perimetry uses fixed targets while kinetic perimetry uses moving ones.
There are several methods for performing perimetry.
Visual fields by confrontation is a method in which the patient covers one eye and identifies how many fingers the examiner is holding up in different quadrants of the visual field.
The simplest form of perimetry devices uses a white tangent screen and presents different sized pins attached to a black wand, which may be moved, against a black background.
The pins may be white or colored.
The use of a white background and lights of incremental brightness is called "white-on-white" perimetry and is the most commonly used in clinical practice for the early detection of blind spots and research trials where loss of visual field must be measured.
However, the sensitivity of white-on-white perimetry is low and as many as 25-50 percent of the photoreceptor cells may be lost before changes in visual field acuity are detected.
The Goldmann perimeter is a hollow white spherical bowl positioned a set distance in front of the patient.
An examiner presents a test light of variable size and intensity, which may be fixed of move towards the center from the perimeter.
The Goldmann method is able to test the entire range of peripheral vision, and has been used for years to follow vision changes in glaucoma patients.
More recently, automated perimetry has become common.
Humphrey visual field is an example of automated, static perimetry that measures the level of light sensitivity within the field of vision by adjusting the intenisty and size of a target illumination.
Automated kinetic perimetry uses a mobile stimulus that is controlled by a perimetry machine, with the patient indicating whether he sees the light by pushing a button.

Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) (1,1-Dimethylhydrazine) is a toxic volatile hygroscopic clear liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammoniacal smell typical for organic amines.
It turns yellowish on exposure to air and absorbs oxygen and carbon dioxide.
It mixes completely with water, ethanol, and kerosene.
UDMH is toxic, a carcinogen and can explode in the presence of oxidisers.
It can be absorbed through skin.
During the 1980s there was concern about the levels of UDMH in various foods being a cancer risk, especially for apple juice.
Klebsiella oxytoca is a Gram-negative, non-motile bacterium of the genus Klebsiella.
They are present in soil and water and part of the human intestinal tract flora.
K. oxytoca can spread to other parts of the body and cause life-threatening diseases, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bacteremia.
K. oxytoca is frequently spread in intensive care units or nursing homes and primarily affects individuals with diseases causing weak immune systems, including alcoholism, diabetes, chronic bronchopulmonary disease.

IDH1 and IDH2 genes encode the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 & 2 enzymes, respectively.
The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme is primarily found in cytoplasm of cells as well as in peroxisomes.
The isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 enzyme is primarily found in mitochondria and involved in intermediary metabolism and energy production.
Mutations in the IDH1 & IDH2 genes are associated with various conditions, including 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, Maffucci syndrome, Ollier disease, cholangiocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, and gliomas.
The mutations associated with Maffucci syndrome, Ollier disease, and other cancer-related conditions are somatic gain-of-function mutations in which the enzymes take on a new, abnormal function.

Lynch syndrome (HNPCC or Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition which has a high risk of colon cancer as well as other cancers including endometrium, ovary, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, upper urinary tract, brain, and skin.
The increased risk for these cancers is due to inherited mutations that impair DNA mismatch repair.
HNPCC defects in DNA mismatch repair lead to microsatellite instability, also known as MSI-H, which is a hallmark of HNPCC.
MSI is identifiable in cancer specimens in the pathology laboratory.
Most cases result in changes in the lengths of dinucleotide repeats of the nucleobases cytosine and adenine (sequence: CACACACACA...).
HNPCC is known to be associated with mutations in genes involved in the DNA mismatch repair pathway: MSH2 MLH1 MSH6 PMS2 PMS1 TGFBR2 MLH3
A group of about 30 HPVs, typically transmitted through sexual contact.
Genital HPV infection is very common, with estimates suggesting that up to 75% of women will become infected with one or more of the sexually transmitted HPV types at some point during adulthood (Baseman and Koutsky, 2005).
Some sexually transmitted HPVs, such as types 6 and 11, can cause genital warts.
However, most HPV types that infect the genitals tend not to cause noticeable symptoms.
Persistent infection with a subset of about a dozen so-called high-risk sexually transmitted HPVs, including types 16,18,31, and 33, can lead to the development of anogenital cancers, including cervical, penile and anal.
HPV infection is a necessary factor in the development of nearly all cases of cervical cancer (Walboomers 1999).
Cervical Pap smear testing is used to detect HPV-induced cellular abnormalities.
This allows targeted surgical removal of pre-cancerous lesions prior to the development of invasive cervical cancer.

The Reptilase Clotting Time measures the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by snake venom Reptilase (Atroxin).
The enzyme is similar to thrombin, but unlike thrombin, is not affected by the presence of heparin.
It measures the availability of functional fibrinogen.
It is sometimes used in lupus anticoagulant screening, along with thrombin time, as a reflex test if any of the screening test results are out of range in order to detect the presence of non-heparin anticoagulants, dysfibrogenemia, or hypofibrogenemia.
Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochetal bacterium that is closely related to the Borrelia species that causes tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), and it is more distantly related to the Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease.
First identified in 1995 in ticks from Japan, B. miyamotoi has since been detected in two species of North American ticks, the black-legged or "deer" tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus).
These ticks are already known to transmit several diseases, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis.
Patients with B. miyamotoi infection are most likely to have fever, chills, and headache.
Other common symptoms included body and joint pain and fatigue.
Unlike Lyme disease, rash is uncommon, presenting in only 4 out of 51 patients.
Patients infected with B. miyamotoi have been treated with a 2-4 week course of doxycycline, amoxicillin, or ceftriaxone.
Fewer than 60 well-documented cases of human infection have been reported in the United States as of July 2015.
The route of transmission of B. miyamotoi to humans has not been firmly established, but likely involves the bite of infected black-legged ticks.
The glpQ gene encodes a periplasmic enzyme, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase of 333 amino acids produced initially with a 25 residue long signal sequence.
GlpQ is not found in Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease.
Hawkinsin ((2-L-cystein-S-yl-1,4-dihydroxycyclohex-5-en-1-yl)-acetic acid) is an intermediate metabolite in the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate hydroxylase reaction, and is elevated in the urine of patients with an autosomal dominant inborn error of metabolism called hawkinsinuria.
Hawkinsinuria is caused by heterozygous mutation in the HPD gene, which is on chromosome 12q24, and encodes 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase.
Metabolic acidosis and tyrosinemia are transient, and symptoms improve within the first year of life.
Some patients have been successfully treated with a special diets, such as tyrosine and phenylalanine restriction or general protein restriction, which resulted in metabolic correction and rapid catch-up growth.
von Willebrand factor (vWF) cleaving protease, or ADAMTS13, is a metalloprotease that cleaves vWF and thereby limits platelet aggregation and formation of microthrombi.
vWF cleaving protease inhibitors can decrease the protease activity and/or more rapidly remove the enzyme from the circulation.
Such inhibitors are one cause of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, anemia, fever, and neurologic and renal abnormalities.
Idiopathic TTP is often due to anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, while inherited TTP is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene that lead to impaired protease function.
Work-up of patients with TTP can include vWF cleaving protease activity and, if that activity is low, inhibitor screen followed by quantification.
B cell-activating factor (BAFF) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that advances the survival of B cells, the class switch recombination of heavy-chains, and can also activate T-cells.
BAFF-R is the BAFF cell surface receptor and is present on the majority of B cells and a subset of T cells in the circulation.
BAFF and BAFF-R normally play a role in B- and T- cell development and regulating humoral immunity, but in pathological conditions, may promote the survival of malignant B cells.
The expression of BAFF-R has been associated with 78% of lymphoproliferative disorders including follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but not others such as precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.
In addition, BAFF-R is not a marker for classical Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas.
Elaeis is a genus consisting of only 2 species of Palms.
Elaeis guineensis originally occurred in Africa, and Elaeis oleifera in Central and South America.
The trees are now cultivated throughout the tropics and sometimes grown as ornamentals in other parts of the world, in particular in southern Florida.
Palm oil from this genus is the second most frequently consumed vegetable oil in the world.
Oil palm pollen may commonly induce symptoms of allergic rhinitis and asthma in sensitised individuals.
BK virus (BKV) is a ubiquitous polyoma virus (belonging to the family Papovaviridae) that is often acquired during early childhood.
BKV is a small (~45 nm) icosahedral, non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus composed of 5,000 base pairs.
The primary BKV infection often occurs around ages 3-4 years old, after which it lies dormant in the genito-urinary tract and can become reactivated in certain immunocompromised disease states including renal transplant and HIV.
A higher prevalence of BKV is seen among HIV positive patients with lower CD4 cell counts.
The mechanism for BKV transmission is still unknown but is speculated to be fecal-oral, respiratory, and via organ transplant.
Peripheral deiodinase activity is the rate of conversion of circulating T4 to the biologically active T3 by monodeiodination.
Changes in peripheral deiodinase activity may reflect conditions that are difficult to diagnose based on traditional thyroid function tests, such as non-thyroidal illness syndrome.
Estimated sum activity of peripheral deiodinases (GD) represents deiodination capacity, i.e. the maximal amount of T3 that can be formed from T4 in one second.
SPINA-GD is calculated with GD = beta31 * (KM1 +) *
(1 + K30 *) * / (alpha31 *) or GD = beta31 * (KM1 +) * / (alpha31 *) from serum or plasma concentrations of free (FT3) or total (TT3) triiodothyronine and free (FT4) or total (TT4) thyroxine, and some constants (alpha31 = Dilution factor for T3: 0.026 l-1; beta31 = Clearance exponent for T3: 8e-6 sec-1; KM1 = Dissociation constant of type-1-deiodinase: 5e-7 mol/l; K30 = Dissociation constant T3-TBG: 2e9 l/mol)

Vitamin E is fat soluble, and malabsorption and deficiency may develop in cases of chronic intraluminal intestinal bile deficiency.
This has been particularly noted in premature infants and children with biliary atresia or cystic fibrosis (chronic intrahepatic cholestasis).
Clinically this may lead to a hemolytic anemia, due to increased erythrocyte fragility, or to a slowly progressive neurologic disorder characterized by ataxia, areflexia, gaze disturbances, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation.
A similar syndrome has been reported in adults with malabsorption.
The syndrome may respond to treatment with parenteral vitamin E. Early treatment with vitamin E may delay or prevent the neuropathy with ataxia that develops during the course of abetalipoproteinemia.
Vitamin E therapy, in some cases, may have a favorable effect on moderate and severe cases of the retinopathy of prematurity and the retinopathy of abetalipoproteinemia.
While lipid malabsorption syndrome (with steatorrhea and malabsorption of vitamin E) may be etiologically related to ataxic spinocerebellar neurologic degenerative disease, there are reports of familial and sporadic vitamin E deficiency with neurologic impairment in the absence of fat malabsorption or demonstrated plasma lipoprotein level abnormality.
An inherited defect in hepatocyte secretion of vitamin E into lipoprotein has been proposed.
The importance of not overlooking a treatable cause of neurologic degenerative disease has been emphasized.
Topotecan (brand name Hycamtin) is used to treat ovarian cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy, for second-line treatment of small cell lung cancer, and for cervical cancer (FDA approved in adults).

One single unit of random donor platelets is not enough to appreciably increase the platelet count of a patient.
Therefore, the usual dose in an adult patient with bleeding and a platelet count below 20,000/uL is 6-8 units of random donor platelets.
Therefore, 6-8 units of random donor platelets are pooled into one bag of "Pooled Platelets".
Mitragynine (MG) is one of the primary alkaloids of kratom, which is the name given to the leaves and leaf extracts of the Mitragyna speciose tree.
It is not an opioid but has similar effects without the same degree of respiratory depression and potential for abuse.
Kratom was used for centuries in parts of the world, including Southeast Asia where the tree is native, for pain management, and more recently has been used for opioid withdrawal.
However, its use is controversial, and it is illegal in some parts of the world, including Thailand, Australia, and many other countries, as well as several states in the United States.

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is caused by a deletion of the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 (4p-).
The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals with larger deletions tending to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions.
The signs and symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn are related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 4, including WHSC1, LETM1, and MSX1.
Researchers believe that loss of the WHSC1 gene is associated with many of the characteristic features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, including the distinctive facial appearance and developmental delay.
Deletion of the LETM1 gene appears to be associated with seizures or other abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
A loss of the MSX1 gene may be responsible for the dental abnormalities and cleft lip and/or palate that are often seen with this condition.
Between 85 and 90 percent of all cases of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome are not inherited.
In the remaining cases, an affected individual inherits a copy of 4p- a parent who carries a balanced chromosomal rearrangement between chromosome 4 and another chromosome.
No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems in the parent.
Anaplasma is a genus of rickettsiales bacteria.
Anaplasmas reside in host red blood cells and lead to anaplasmosis, a disease most commonly occurs in tropical areas of the world.
Anaplasmas require intermediate tick hosts for maturation, and flies may act as mechanical vectors.
The major consequence of infection is the development of haemolytic anaemia due to the damage done to red blood cells.
Species of veterinary interest include: Anaplasma marginale and Anaplasma centrale in cattle Anaplasma mesaeterum and Anaplasma ovis in sheep and goats
Levmetamfetamine (other names: l-desoxyephedrine, l-methamphetamine, levo-methamphetamine) is the l- stereoisomer of methamphetamine, a sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor which may be used in over-the-counter nasal decongestants.
The common brand-name for levmetamfetamine in the U.S. is the Vicks Inhaler.
L-methamphetamine alone can raise blood pressure and cause the heart to beat rapidly due to its effects mimicking the sympathetic nervous system, but is not thought to be nearly as addictive or centrally active as the d- isomer of methamphetamine.
Its common side effects include muscle tremors and stomach cramps.
The Almond is the fruit of a vigorous, deep-rooted deciduous small tree belonging to the Rose family, which grows best in areas with dry, warm summers.
The plant is believed to be a native of northern Africa and the Middle East.
It occurs wild in Sicily and Greece and is extensively cultivated in northern Africa, southern Europe, Australia and the warmer parts of the United States, particularly California.
Almond may frequently result in sensitisation and may commonly induce symptoms of food allergy.
Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19), is encoded by the FGF19 gene.
It binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 and is involved in adipocyte glucose uptake and the suppression of bile acid biosynthesis.
FGF-19 is fully active in the presence of a cofactor - beta-Klotho protein.
FGF-19 is created after every meal and plays a role in increasing glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreasing gluconeogenesis.
Obesity in adults and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese adolescents is associated with lower levels of FGF-19, while patients on hemodialysis have higher FGF-19 levels compared to the healthy population.
A plant species in the genus SAMBUCUS, known for the elderberry fruit.

Rh is the most complex of the blood groups systems, encompassing over 45 distinct antigens.
The most clinical important antigen, D or Rho, was first described in 1940 and is present in over 85% of the population.
Those individuals who lack the D antigen are considered to be Rh negative.
The Rh antigens are encoded by two highly homologous and closely linked genes on the short arm of chromosome 1.
The RHD gene codes for the D antigen, or most of its components; RhCE gene codes the Cc and Ee antigens or their variants.
The majority of the antigens within this system represent products of gene cross-over, point mutations or deletions within one or both genes.
The Rh antigens appear to be expressed only on red blood cell and they appear early during red cell development.
Antibodies against the Rh antigens have caused severe and fatal transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn.
Rh antigens have been implicated in many diseases such as auto-immune hemolytic anemia, auto-Rh antibodies.

The LW and D antigens are closely related.
Rh+ red cells express LW more strongly than Rh negative cells.
The early nomenclature tried to accommodate this observation by using a numerical system; eg. LW1, LW2, etc.
but this changed following Sistonen's report of a new low frequency antigen called Ne^a which was found in ~5% of Finns.
Because further work suggested that the Ne^a gene was allelic to LW, they were renamed LW^a and LW^b (Ne^a).
Thus, the null phenotype for this system would be LW(a-b-) which is extremely rare and is the result of a partial gene deletion.
A transient or acquired form of LW(a-b-) has been reported and these individuals are found because they produce a transient anti-LW.
Some (but not all) examples have been associated with terminal illnesses such as Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, sarcomas or other malignancies.

Whitlockite is a mineral, an unusual form of calcium phosphate.
Its formula is Ca9(MgFe)(PO4)6PO3OH.
Whitlockite can be found in biological systems and has been implicated in several human diseases.
Whitlockite can be found at many different sites in the human body, but is particularly concentrated in calcified tissues, such as embryonic and adult bone.
The highest concentrations of whitlockite appear in the weight bearing area of the femoral head.
Traces of whitlockite have also been found in tuberculous lesions, urinary calculi and even prostatic deposits.
Whitlockite can also be found in the oral cavity, where it is a primary component of dental calculi and salivary stones.
Lastly, whitlockite can be found in aortic media, where it may be involved in arteriosclerosis.
The presence of whitlockite at these different locations has not attracted much attention from biomedical scientists or clinicians, chiefly because whitlockite is not visible with the stains used to routinely examine microscopic sections of healthy or diseased tissue.
However, the presence of whitlockite does become obvious when X-ray diffraction is used to examine these same sections.
In part, whitlockite occurs commonly in biologic systems because of the high concentrations of proteolipids and divalent cations in biologic fluids.
Formation of this type of whitlockite is magnesium rich, and is preferred at temperatures typical of biologic systems because of the smaller diameter of the magnesium ion compared to calcium.
Stromelysin-1 (MMP-3, Matrix metalloproteinase-1) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP3 gene.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) produces a heat-labile (LT) and a heat-stable (ST) enterotoxin, both of which cause severe diarrhea in both humans and animals.
ST is an extracellular toxin which is comprised of a methanol-soluble (STa) toxin and a methanol-insoluble (STb) toxin.
The sta gene encodes the STa toxin and the stb gene encodes the STb toxin. ; STa combines to its enterocyte receptor, guanylate cyclase, which causes intestinal secretion and diarrhea.
The STb enterocyte receptor is the protein sulfatide.
After STb binds to sulfatide, it is engulfed by the enterocyte.
It then activates the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein which opens the ligand-gated calcium ion channel, allowing an influx of calcium ions.
A subsequent secretion of chloride ions, stimulation of arachidonic acid release, and production of prostaglandin E2 and 5-dyroxytryptamine leads to an efflux of water, bicarbonate ions, sodium ions, and chloride ions into the intestinal space, all of which leads to watery diarrhea.

Lactic acid (IUPAC systematic name:2-hydroxypropanoic acid), also known as milk acid, is a chemical compound that plays a role in several biochemical processes.
Lactic acid is a carboxylic acid (formula C 3 H 6 O 3) that has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, making it an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA).
In solution, it can lose a proton from the acidic group, producing the lactate ion CH3 CH(OH)COOË'.
Lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers.
One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(-)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid.
L-(+)-Lactic acid is the biologically important isomer.
L-Lactate is produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation.
Lactate is constantly produced during normal metabolism and exercise but does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal.
This is an abnormally sized red blood cell.
By definition it is 5 micrometers or smaller in diameter and is often associated with several forms of anemia.
IgA has two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) and can exist in a dimeric form called secretory IgA (sIgA).
In its secretory form, IgA is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions, including tears, saliva, colostrum and secretions from the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, prostate and respiratory epithelium.
It is also found in small amounts in blood.
The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, thus sIgA can survive in the harsh gastrointestinal tract environment and provide protection against microbes that multiply in body secretions.
Decreased or absent IgA, termed selective IgA deficiency, can be a clinically significant immunodeficiency.
Neisseria gonorrhÅae (which causes gonorrhea), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae type B all releases a protease which destroys IgA. IgA nephropathy is caused by IgA deposits in the kidneys.
It is not yet known why IgA deposits occur in this chronic disease.
Some theories suggest an abnormality of the immune system results in these deposits.
Celiac disease involves IgA pathology due to the presence of IgA antiendomysial antibodies.
The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is a calculation used in medicine to help determine the cause of ascites.
The SAAG may be a better discriminant than the older method of classifying ascites fluid as a transudate versus exudate.
The formula is as follows: SAAG = (albumin concentration of serum) - (albumin concentration of ascitic fluid).
Ideally, the two values should be measured at the same time.
A high gradient (> 1.1 g/dL) indicates the ascites is due to portal hypertension with 97% accuracy.
Important causes of high SAAG ascites include: 1) high protein (> 2.5) which can lead to heart failure, and 2) low protein (< 2.5) which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver (Budd Chiari syndrome).
A low gradient (< 1.1 g/dL) indicates causes of ascites not associated with increased portal pressure, including nephrotic syndrome, tuberculosis, and various types of cancer.

The detection of EML4-ALK may be useful for predicting the potential response to ALK inhibitors as a therapeutic option for patients with lung cancer.
The VHL gene (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) is located on chromosome 3p25.3.
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of malignant and benign tumors.
A germline mutation of this gene is the basis of familial inheritance of VHL syndrome.
The protein encoded by this gene is a component of the protein complex that includes elongin B, elongin C, and cullin-2, and possesses ubiquitin ligase E3 activity.
This protein is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen.
RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2G/RPB7 is also reported to be a target of this protein.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.
The FBN1 gene (fibrillin 1) is located on chromosome 15q21.1.
This gene encodes a member of the fibrillin family.
The encoded protein is a large, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that serve as a structural component of 10-12 nm calcium-binding microfibrils.
These microfibrils provide force bearing structural support in elastic and nonelastic connective tissue throughout the body.
Mutations in this gene are associated with Marfan syndrome, isolated ectopia lentis, autosomal dominant Weill-Marchesani syndrome, MASS syndrome, and Shprintzen-Goldberg craniosynostosis syndrome.

Emetine inhibits protein synthesis in eucaryotic but not prokaryotic cells.
FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) also known as scurfin is a protein involved in immune system responses.
A member of the FOX protein family, FOXP3 appears to function as a master regulator in the development and function of regulatory T cells.
While the precise control mechanism has not yet been established, FOX proteins belong to the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators and are presumed to exert control via similar DNA binding interactions during transcription.
In human disease, alterations in numbers of regulatory T cells - and in particular those that express Foxp3 - are found in a number of disease states.
For example, patients with tumors have a local relative excess of Foxp3 positive T cells which inhibits the body's ability to suppress the formation of cancerous cells.
Conversely, patients with an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a relative dysfunction of Foxp3 positive cells.
The Foxp3 gene is also mutated in the X-linked IPEX syndrome (Immunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, and Enteropathy, X-linked).
These mutations were in the forkhead domain of FOXP3, indicating that the mutations may disrupt critical DNA interactions.
Gestational Pemphigoid or Pemphigoid Gestationis (PG) is a dermatosis of pregnancy, being an autoimmune blistering skin disease that occurs during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester, and/or immediately following pregnancy.
It was originally called herpes gestationis because of the blistering appearance, although it is not associated with the herpes virus.
Peach, Prunus persica, is the fruit of a deciduous tree growing as high as 10 m and belonging to the subfamily Prunoideae of the family Rosaceae.
It is classified with the Almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell.
The Peach is a tree native to China.
It was introduced to Persia and the Mediterranean region through the Silk Road in early historical times, probably by about 2000 BC.
Important historical Peach-producing areas are China, Japan, Iran, and the countries in the Mediterranean region; and more recently, the US, Canada, and Australia.
Peach is a well-documented and common cause of allergy in children and adults, resulting in oral allergy and systemic reactions such as urticaria, asthma and anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of the fresh or processed fruit.
This is particularly the case in the Mediterranean area, where Peach is regarded as a major allergen.
Peach has also been described as the primary cause of food anaphylaxis in Israel.
In Japan, Peach has been reported to be a frequent cause of oral allergy syndrome (OAS).

Iclaprim, codenamed AR-100 and RO-48-2622, is a diaminopyrimidine dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
It is structurally related to trimethoprim.
In Phase III clinical trials, intravenously-administered iclaprim was found to be as effective as and better tolerated than linezolid in people with skin and soft tissue infections, many caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
In vitro, iclaprim is highly active against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to several common antibiotics, and some Gram-negative bacteria.
A new drug application for iclaprim was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2008, and a marketing authorisation application (MAA) was accepted by the European Medicines Agency on August 21, 2008.
Phase II clinical trials are being conducted to assess whether iclaprim can be taken by mouth as well as intravenously and whether it is effective for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Iclaprim has been granted fast track status by the FDA
Endoxifen, a secondary metabolite of Tamoxifen
At least 19 mutations in the ACAD8 gene are known to cause isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IBD) deficiency.
Some of these mutations reduce the activity of the IBD enzyme, while other mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional enzyme.
As a result, valine is not broken down properly.
An inability to process valine is thought to lead to reduced energy production and the features of IBD deficiency.

The nephrostomy tube drains urine from the kidney into an external drainage pouch.
Beryllium is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Be and atomic number 4.
A bivalent element, beryllium is a steel grey, strong, light-weight yet brittle, alkaline earth metal, that is primarily used as a hardening agent in alloys (most notably beryllium copper).
'Anticomplementary activity' (AA) can interfere with complement fixation tests because it results in the activation of complement in the absence of the antibody-antigen complex that is being tested for.
Anticomplementary activity is usually caused by complement-activating factors in patient sera including immune complexes and contaminating substances such as endotoxin.
Testing for AA is critical to exclude the possibility of such non-specific anticomplement activity .

The identification of tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the first true "designer androgen," as a sports doping agent reflects both an alarmingly sophisticated illicit manufacturing facility and an underground network of androgen abusers in elite sports, as well as the still untapped potential for designer androgens in medicine.
Never marketed, THG was apparently developed as a potent androgen that was undetectable by conventional International Olympic Committee-mandated urinary sports doping tests.
As a potent androgen and progestin with unspecified contaminants, its distribution for use at high doses without any prior biological or toxicological evaluation poses significant health risks.
Yet this diversion of science also highlights the prospect of designer androgens for use in human medicine.
Designer androgens also offer the possibility of tissue-specific effects enhancing the beneficial effects of androgens while mitigating the undesirable ones.
Further developments require better understanding of the post receptor tissue selectivity of androgens, comparable to the mechanism underlying that of partial estrogen agonists (SERMs).
This experience highlights the ongoing need for vigilance to detect novel drug doping strategies in order to maintain fairness and safety in elite sports.
This will require the deployment of generic catch-all tests, such as sensitive and specific in vitro androgen bioassays, coupled with the development of mass spectrometry-based tests for specific doping agents.
Starting from gestrinone, chemists can synthesize THG in one reaction step. ,
Hemoglobin G Philadelphia (HbG Phil) is a structural variant of the hemoglobin molecule that involves the alpha chain rather than the beta chain.
It has a frequency of about 1 in 5,000 African Americans, but has been reported in other ethnic groups in the Mediterranean region as well, HbG Phil itself has no clinical consequences.
The only finding of clinical interest is the mild microcytosis.
While this molecule has no clinical consequences, the presence helps to distinguish HbG from HbD that shares its electrophoretic migration on HPLC and gel electrophoresis and which does have consequences when it occurs with sickle trait.

The most common form of sodium is sodium chloride--table salt.
Milk, beets, and celery also naturally contain sodium.
Drinking water also contains sodium, but the amount depends on the source.
Sodium is also added to many food products, such as, monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate.
These are in items such as Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion salt, garlic salt, and bouillon cubes.
Processed meats like bacon, sausage, and ham, and canned soups and vegetables also contain added sodium.
Fast foods are generally very high in sodium.
Too much sodium in the diet may lead to high blood pressure in some people or a serious buildup of fluid in people with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or kidney disease.

While the presence of IgM antibodies suggests current or recent infection, low levels of IgM antibodies may occasionally persists for more than 12 months post-infection.
Erythropoiesis is the process by which red blood cells (erythrocytes) are produced in bone marrow.
It is stimulated by decreased O2 in circulation, leading to secretion of the hormone erythropoietin by the kidneys.
This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors, which activates increased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues and ultimately producing red blood cells.
In certain diseases, erythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow, e.g. within the spleen or liver, and is known as extramedullary erythropoiesis.
Individuals with anemia have abnormally low levels of red blood cells whereas those with polycythemia have abnormally high levels of red blood cells.
Isopropyl methylphosphonate (GB acid) a metabolite of the chemical warfare nerve agent Sarin (aka GB).

Antithrombin and antithrombin III refer to the same thing but today, however, antithrombin is the correct name.
Antithrombin is a small glycoprotien, produced in the liver that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system including thrombin as well as factors Xa, IXa, XIa, XIIa, and kallikrein.
Heparan sulfate (heparin), located on endothelial cells, binds to antithrombin causing a conformational change that results in its activation.
Antithrombin deficiency is present in 0.17% of the general population.
It accounts for 1.1% of unselected patients with venous thrombosis and up to 5% of patients younger than 70 years with thrombosis.
Over 127 mutations in the antithrombin gene are known to cause hereditary antithrombin deficiency.
Individuals heterozygous for antithrombin deficiency have a fivefold increased risk for venous thrombosis.
Homozygous deficiencies are usually fatal.
Vitamin K antagonist therapy causes a decrease in the active forms of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, with a concomitant increase in non-functional forms of these factors.
These non-functional proteins are called "proteins induced by vitamin K absence/antagonism", or PIVKA, and can act as competetive inhibitors of thromboplastin, depending on the source.
Human recombinant and bovine thromboplastins are sensitive to PIVKA, while rabbit thromboplastin is not.
Prothrombin time (PT) assays that use PIVKA-sensitive thromboplastin are considered to be more sensitive to factor II, VII and X deficiencies compared to standard PT assays.

Carboxyhemoglobin, a complex of hemoglobin and carbon monoxide, is a marker of exposure to inhaled carbon monoxide (CO).
CO gas is produced from almost any fire as the result of incomplete combustion to CO2, and the normal individual will have about 1 or 2 % of their hemoglobin in the form of carboxyhemoglobin, and up to 5% depending on environmental circumstances.
Smokers can have levels as high as 10% or even higher.
Poisoning with CO generally results from improperly vented furnaces, automobile exhaust, and fires, with carboxyhemoglobin:hemoglobin ratios of 10-30% found in symptomatic individuals and 30-90% in fatalities.
With a 230 fold greater affinity, inhaled CO avidly replaces oxygen at its hemoglobin binding site.
In addition, replacing even one of the 4 sites of the hemoglobin tetramer with CO prevents dissociation of the remaining 3 oxygen moieties to tissue (known as left shift of O2 dissociation curve).
As a result, hemoglobin remains red and skin color is rosy despite physiologic anoxia.
Although measuring carboxyhemoglobin can confirm carbon monoxide poisoning, the level does not always correlate with the clinical picture; carbon monoxide poisoning involves other mechanisms as well, including binding to myoglobin, cytochrome oxidase, and direct effects on the central nervous system.
Oral clonidine stimulates growth hormone secretion, and a clonidine stimulation test is used to evaluate growth hormone deficiency.
Clonidine is administered in the morning after an overnight fast, and blood samples are collected at predefined intervals.

West Nile virus Kunjin strain is a mosquito-borne virus that affects humans and horses and is one of the two etiologic agents of human arboviral encephalitis in Australia (the second is Murray Valley encephalitis virus).
Human West Nile Kunjin infections are primarily asymptomatic, and cases of encephalitis mainly existed in northwestern Australia until 2011.
In 2011, extensive flooding in Eastern Australia provided ideal conditions for mosquito breeding, which led to a major outbreak of equine encephalitis.
The responsible agent was West Nile virus New South Wales 2011 (WNV NSW2011), a virulent strain of West Nile Kunjin that resulted in 10-15% mortality of infected horses.
Since 2011, symptomatic West Nile Kunjin human infections have increased on the southeastern side of Australia, close to major urban areas on the eastern seaboard of New South Wales, but equine cases still far outnumber human cases.

Propofol (marketed as Diprivan by Fresenius Kabi) is a short-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic/amnestic agent.
Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation.
Propofol is also commonly used in veterinary medicine.
It is approved for use in more than 50 countries, and generic versions are available.
Chemically, propofol is not related to barbiturates and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and "clear" when compared with thiopental.
Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to alleviate pain.
Propofol has been referred to as milk of amnesia (a play on words of milk of magnesia), because of the milk-like appearance of its intravenous preparation.
It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a health system.

Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4+ T-cells that provide protection from excess inflammation and tissue damage that would result from untethered immune responses directed against self, dietary, or environmental antigens.
Tregs are characterized and dependent upon the expression of lineage-specific transcription factor Foxp3 and high levels of interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor alpha-chain (CD25).
Tregs require the expression of CD25 for their differentiation and proliferative fitness and are dependent on IL2 signaling for their maintenance.
Tregs suppress immune-mediated inflammation that is associated with autoimmune and auto-inflammatory disorders, allergies, acute and chronic infections, and cancer.
Associations of Tregs with disease has prompted investigations into the manipulation of Tregs for therapeutic purposes.
Yersinia enterocolitica is a species of gram-negative coccobacillus-shaped bacterium, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.

It is a carboxylic acid (chemical formula C3H6O3) and is chiral with two optical isomers: L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and D-(â)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid.
In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise.
It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal, which is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, concentration and isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues.
The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1-2 mmol/L at rest, but can rise to over 20 mmol/L during intense exertion.

Populus species are entirely wind pollinated, as distinct from Willows, which are primarily insect-pollinated.
Glycoprotein I (gI) has a 130,000 molecular weight and is one of the major constituents of the envelope of pseudorabies virus (PRV) strain Phylaxia.
Although gI is one of the major immunogens in vaccinated and/or virus-infected animals, one study showed that viruses resistant to anti-gI antibodies occur spontaneously in vivo and in vitro, therefore using gI as a subunit vaccine would not be beneficial..
Instead, since the majority of PrV vaccines now contain attenuated gI-deleted PRV and all tested isolates of PrV from field infected animals contain the gI protein, the presence of antibodies to gI appears to be the best method for verifying standard field virus infection.
One study showed that exposure to the virus could be detected as early as day 7 and up to 141 days after field virus exposure.
In inorganic chemistry, a sulfate (IUPAC -recommended spelling; also sulphate in British English) is a salt of sulfuric acid.

Exercise intensity levels can be categorized as light, moderate or vigorous.
Intensity can be further defined in absolute or relative terms.
Absolute exercise intensity is independent of an individual's level of fitness and defined in terms of metabolic equivalents, or METs, which is a unit useful for describing the energy expenditure of a specific activity.
Light intensity exercise is defined at 1.1-2.9 METs, moderate is 3.0 to 5.9 METs and vigorous is 6.0 METs or more, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (2008).
The Advisory Committee indicated that 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity activity per week could be regarded as (roughly) equivalent to 500 MET-minutes per week.
Relative intensity takes an individual's level of fitness and can be defined in terms of a percent of a person's (1) maximal heart rate, (2) heart rate reserve, or (3) aerobic capacity reserve.
Relative moderate intensity is defined as 40 to 59 percent of aerobic capacity reserve (where 0 percent of reserve is resting and 100 percent of reserve is maximal effort).
Relatively vigorous-intensity activity is defined as 60 to 84 percent of reserve.
Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell nucleus divides in two, and is followed by division of the parent cell into two daughter cells.

Both are active against many gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.
Leukocyte esterase (LE) is an enzyme contained in WBCs.
In fluids that are usually cell "free", detection of this enzyme indicates the presence of a significant number of WBCs which can signal infection or inflammation.
In urine, this test is used to detect white blood cells and other abnormalities associated with infections.
White blood cells in the urine usually indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI).
The LE test detects esterase, an enzyme released by white blood cells.
Testing for LE is a routine part of the urine dip stick, and helps to diagnose urinary tract infections.
Positive test results are clinically significant.
The LE test is also used to screen for gonorrhea and for amniotic fluid infections.
The combination of the LE test with the urinary nitrite test provides an excellent tool for the presence of a UTI.
A urine sample that tests positive for both nitrite and leukocyte esterase should be cultured for pathogenic bacteria.
Pentan-2-one or methyl propyl ketone is a colorless liquid ketone with an odor resembling that of acetone.
Its formula is C5H10O.
It is sometimes used in very small amounts as a flavoring food additive.
Two other ketones, 3-pentanone and methyl isopropyl ketone are isomers of 2-pentanone.
Epidemic typhus, also called Jail Fever, Hospital Fever or Famine fever is a form of typhus caused by the bacillus Rickettsia prowazekii, carried by the human body louse Pediculus humanus humanus.
Feeding on a human who carries the bacillus infects the louse.
R. prowazekii grows in the louse's gut and is excreted in the feces.
The disease is transmitted to an uninfected human who scratches the bite and rubs the feces into the wound.
Incubation period is one to two weeks.
R. prowazekii can remain viable and virulent in the dried feces for many days.
The disease will kill the louse and it will remain viable for many weeks in the dead louse.
The symptoms set in quickly, and are among the most severe of the typhus family.
They include severe headache, a sustained high fever, cough, rash, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, sensitivity to light, and delirium.
Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a disease of horses caused by an RNA virus of the genus Arterivirus.
There is no known human hazard.
Arteriviruses are small, enveloped, animal viruses with an icosahedral core containing a positive-sense RNA genome.
The family includes Equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV).
Barbiturates are CNS depressants that primarily act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABA A receptors.
When GABA binds to GABA A, chloride channels open and allow the influx of chloride ions, which decrease the membrane potential and inhibit the neuron's action potential.
They are used as sedatives, hypnotics, anesthetics, and anticonvulsants.
Prolonged use can lead to physical tolerance and dependence, which has caused a significant decrease in their use over time.
However, certain uses are still common, such as phenobarbital for refractory seizure disorders, butalbital for analgesia, and thiopental for anesthesia.
Fibrin monomers are created when Thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B from fibrinogen.
The presence of fibrin monomer may be an early indicator of pro-thrombin activity.
Fibrin monomer concentrations are typically compared with those of D-dimer to monitor various hemostatic conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) status.
Fibrin monomers are referred to by many names: Fibrin Monomer, Soluble Fibrin Monomer, Soluble Fibrin, Fibrin Monomer Complexes, and Fibrin Monomer Complexes, all which are indistinguishable and interchangeable.
Passion fruit is grown in much of the tropical and subtropical world, including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Jamaica, South Africa, Malaya, Fiji and Hawaii.

Cryptococcus species are encapsulated yeast that cause cryptococcosis, an opportunistic infection that primary affects patients who are immunocompromised.
Manifestations of Cryptococcus infection include meningitis and pulmonary cryptococcosis.
Analysis of the DNA encoding the ribosomal RNA, sometimes referred to as rDNA, can differentiate among pathogenic yeast, such as Candida and Cryptococcus, and can also be used to identify specific species, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii, depending on the specific region that is targeted.
A durable T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated that is a more sensitive marker of past infection than humoral response.
As a result, the measurement of cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 using an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) similar to that used for Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proposed as a way to evaluate the immune status of individuals and populations, as well as assess vaccines to SARS CoV-2.

Oxyhemoglobin is formed during respiration when oxygen binds to the heme component of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells.
This process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries adjacent to the alveoli of the lungs.
The oxygen then travels through the blood stream to be dropped off at cells where it is utilized in aerobic glycolysis and in the production of ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation.
It doesn't however help to counteract a decrease in blood pH. Ventilation, or breathing, may reverse this condition by removal of carbon dioxide, thus causing a shift up in pH. Deoxyhemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen.
The absorption spectrums of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ.
The oxyhemoglobine has significantly lower absorption of the 660 nm wavelength than deoxyhemoglobin, while at 940 nm its absorption is slightly higher.
This difference is used for measurement of the amount of oxygen in patient's blood by an instrument called pulse oximeter.
Cyclohexanone is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)5CO.
The molecule consists of six-carbon cyclic molecule with a ketone functional group.
This colorless oil has an odor reminiscent of peardrop sweets as well as acetone.
Over time, samples assume a yellow color due to oxidation.
Cyclohexanone is slightly soluble in water (5-10 g/100 mL), but miscible with common organic solvents.
Billions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly as a precursor to nylon.
The SMN1 gene (survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric) is located on chromosome 5q13.2.
This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13.
This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions.
The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region.
The telomeric and centromeric copies of this gene are nearly identical and encode the same protein.
However, mutations in this gene, the telomeric copy, are associated with spinal muscular atrophy; mutations in the centromeric copy do not lead to disease.
The centromeric copy may be a modifier of disease caused by mutation in the telomeric copy.
The critical sequence difference between the two genes is a single nucleotide in exon 7, which is thought to be an exon splice enhancer.
Note that the nine exons of both the telomeric and centromeric copies are designated historically as exon 1, 2a, 2b, and 3-8.
It is thought that gene conversion events may involve the two genes, leading to varying copy numbers of each gene.
The protein encoded by this gene localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Within the nucleus, the protein localizes to subnuclear bodies called gems which are found near coiled bodies containing high concentrations of small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).
This protein forms heteromeric complexes with proteins such as SIP1 and GEMIN4, and also interacts with several proteins known to be involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs, such as hnRNP U protein and the small nucleolar RNA binding protein.
Multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.
Dermatan sulfate is a derived disaccharide that accumulates in lysosomes, extracellular matrix, and body fluids of people with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs).
MPSs are rare disorders caused by a deficiency of enzymes that break down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
Symptoms of MPS vary due to which storage product accumulates and the level of enzymatic function or concentration that remains.
Symptoms include musculoskeletal, airway, cardiac, and central nervous system disorders.
Treatments include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the more critical forms of MPS and intravenous enzyme replacement therapy for the others.
Treatment is most effective when it is initiated before irreversible tissue damage has occurred.
Because MPS is so rare and the symptoms so variable, it is difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages.
A solution to that problem is the development of newborn screening assays that can detect dermatan sulfate, though the levels in the dried blood spot samples do not appear to predict the severity of disease.
The pattern of dermatan and heparan sulfate can help distinguish between the different MPSs.
The layer of EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX that lies between the ENDOTHELIUM of the glomerular capillaries and the PODOCYTES of the inner or visceral layer of the BOWMAN CAPSULE.

Mycobacterium embB region gene mutation for EMB resistance
Testing for volatile substances, such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and acetone, in whole blood, urine, and other patient specimens is performed to evaluate toxicity.
Ethanol is a significant substance of abuse in the United States.
It is present in beer, wine, vodka, whiskey and other liquors.
The concentration of ethanol in blood correlates with the degree of intoxication.
As a depressant, it alters cerebral function causing typical symptoms such as impaired thought, clouded judgment, and changed behavior.
Methanol and isopropanol are highly toxic volatile substances and result from exogenous ingestion.
Acetone is generally elevated in metabolic conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
Occupational allergen mix 1 (pax1) detects horse dander (e3), cow dander (e4), goose feathers (e70), and chicken feathers (85) IgE antibodies.
Testing for IgE antibodies may be used to help diagnose an allergic disease or the cause of an anaphylactic episode in a patient.
Enzyme and fluorescent-based assays, which were preceded by the RAST test (Radio-AllergoSorbent Test), are performed to detect allergen-specific IgE in the patient's serum.
HIV-1 is the most common and pathogenic strain of the virus.
Scientists divide HIV-1 into a major group (Group M) and two or more minor groups.
Each group is believed to represent an independent transmission of SIV into humans (but subtypes within a group are not).
With 'M' for "major", the M group is by far the most common type of HIV, with more than 90% of HIV/AIDS cases deriving from infection with HIV-1 group M. The M group is subdivided further into clades, called subtypes, that are also given a letter.
There are also "circulating recombinant forms" or CRFs derived from recombination between viruses of different subtypes which are each given a number.
CRF12_BF, for example, is a recombination between subtypes B and F. Subtype A is common in West Africa.
Subtype B is the dominant form in Europe, the Americas, Japan, Thailand, and Australia.
Subtype C is the dominant form in Southern Africa, India, and Nepal.
Subtype D is generally only seen in Eastern and central Africa.
(Subtype E) has never been identified as a nonrecombinant, only recombined with subtype A as CRF01_AE.
Subtype F has been found in central Africa, South America and Eastern Europe.
Subtype G (and the CRF02_AG) have been found in Africa and central Europe.
Subtype H is limited to central Africa.
(Subtype I) was originally used to describe a strain that is now accounted for as CRF04_cpx, with the cpx for a "complex" recombination of several subtypes.
Subtype J is primarily found in North, Central and West Africa, and the Caribbean Subtype K is limited to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon.
These subtypes are sometimes further split into sub-subtypes such as A1 and A2 or F1 and F2.
This is not thought to be a complete or final list, and further types are likely to be found.

This gene is one of eight which have been associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL).
Also referred to as Batten disease, NCL comprises a class of autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorders affecting children.
The genes responsible likely encode proteins involved in the degradation of post-translationally modified proteins in lysosomes.
The primary defect in NCL disorders is thought to be associated with lysosomal storage function.
Skeltal, cardiac and smooth muscle
Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) is a member of the Beta-herpesvirus subfamily.
HHV6 infection is extremely common, with seroprevalence almost 100%.
Primary infection results in a fever that may exceed 40 degrees Celsius and last for 3-5 days.
Primary infection in children often results in fever followed by development of roseola or sixth disease.
The virus exists as latent infection in lymphocytes and monocytes following the primary infection and may be reactivated in immunocompromised patients.

The protein CD86 (Cluster of Differentiation 86) is a molecule which provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation and survival.
It is also known as B7.2.
Its principal mode of action is by binding to CD28.
Along with CD80, these molecules provide the necessary stimuli to prime T cells against antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells.
Prolintane (Catovit) is a stimulant which is closely related in chemical structure to other drugs such as pyrovalerone and with a similar mechanism of action, by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and other monoamine neurotransmitters.
It is a mild stimulant with a good safety profile and relatively low incidence of cardiovascular problems or other side effects such as anorexia and insomnia, although these side effects may still occur at higher doses.
However, the good safety profile of this drug at low doses makes it suitable for use in elderly people to increase motivation and counteract the effects of senile dementia and age-related cognitive decline.
It is mainly used in European countries.
Prolintane may also be abused as a recreational stimulant and use for this purpose has reportedly been increasing in recent years.
Babesia duncani is a parasite that invades human red blood cells and is transmitted by the Ixodid tick.
Infection by the Babesia species was first discovered in Croatia in 1957, but has proven to exist across the world in the last fifty years.
B. duncani primarily infects humans who live in Washington state and California.
The Babesia parasites possess vesicles that secrete enzymes that facilitates its entrance into the host erythrocytes.
They reproduces asexually in red blood cells and sexually in the Ixodid tick.
Infection with Babesia leads to a wide range and severity of symptoms.
Symptoms that are characterized as mild to moderate include fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia cough, arthralgia and nausea.
Symptoms of severe illness are seen most often in patients who are immunosuppressed due to infections like Human immunodeficiency virus and conditions such as cancer.
Severe symptoms of Babesia infection include respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, liver and renal failure, and splenic infarction.
Infection with Babesia duncani tends to cause symptoms that are moderate to severe.
There are several ways to diagnose infections with Babesia including thick and thin smear analysis, polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluorescence antibody, and by injecting patient blood into a hamster and waiting for severe parasitemia to develop in 2-4 weeks.
Treatment of Babesia infection is with antibiotics.

The e prime (e') wave (LOINC component: tissue velocity.
E wave) represents the annular tissue velocity of the mitral or tricuspid valve during early diastole, before atrial contraction.
The blood flow velocity during early diastole is known as the E wave (LOINC component: blood flow velocity.
The early diastolic velocity ratio (E/e') is an indicator of left ventricular diastolic function.
The ratio of early diastolic tissue velocity to tissue velocity during atrial contraction (e'/a') may also be an indicator of left ventricular function but is less reliable than the E/e' ratio.
Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is a natural-occurring mycotoxin produced by certain Fusarium species.
DON predominantly infects various grains, including corn, wheat, oats, barley, and rice, either in the field or during storage.
DON is not considered a significant threat to public health, but some short term nausea and vomiting have been reported along with diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever.
Salmon is the common name for several species of fish of the family Salmonidae.
Several other fish in the family are called trout.
Salmon live in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Great Lakes and other land locked lakes.
The Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Russian Far East, contains the world's greatest salmon sanctuary.
Typically, salmon are anadromous:they are born in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce.
Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they were born to spawn, and modern research shows that usually at least 90% of the fish spawning in a stream were born there.
In Alaska, the crossing over to other streams allows salmon to populate new streams, such as those that emerge as a glacier retreats.
The precise method salmon use to navigate has not been established, though their keen sense of smell seems to play a role.
Finasteride (Proscar and Propecia) is a synthetic antiandrogen that acts by inhibiting type II 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Finasteride, a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and treat male pattern baldness (MPB).
Total spectral power of an EEG recording is the sum of the power in each of the frequency bands alpha, beta, delta, theta, sigma and gamma.

Prostaglandins are fatty acids derived from arachidonic acid metabolism.
They are closely related to the Thromboxanes and Leukotrienes.
Prostaglandin F2a is derived mainly from Prostaglandins E2 and H2, and is metabolized to Dihydroketo Prostaglandin F2a.
Prostaglandin F2a is excreted directly into the urine.
Prostaglandin F2a contracts the circular muscle of the gut in opposition to the Prostaglandins of the E series.
Prostaglandin F2a causes accumulation of water and electrolytes in the lumen of the gut by stimulating their secretion.
It also inhibits glucose absorption.
Prostaglandin F2a has luteolytic actions in the corpus luteum.
Elevated levels of Prostaglandin F2a have been found in the spinal fluid of children with febrile convulsions and menningitis.
Elevated levels of Prostaglandin F2a have been detected in patients with the Watery Diarrhea Syndrome, neural crest tumors, pheochromocytomas, and other amine-peptide-secreting tumors.
Prostaglandin F2a production and circulating levels are drastically suppressed by aspirin and indomethacin.
The RS1 gene (retinoschisin 1) is located on chromosome Xp22.13.
This gene encodes an extracellular protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular organization of the retina.
The encoded protein is assembled and secreted from photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a homo-oligomeric protein complex.
Mutations in this gene are responsible for X-linked retinoschisis, a common, early-onset macular degeneration in males that results in a splitting of the inner layers of the retina and severe loss in vision.

Venlafaxine (brand name Effexor) is used to treat depression.
Venlafaxine extended-release (long-acting) capsules are also used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; excessive worrying that is difficult to control), social anxiety disorder (extreme fear of interacting with others or performing in front of others that interferes with normal life), and panic disorder (sudden, unexpected attacks of extreme fear and worry about these attacks).
Venlafaxine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
It works by increasing the amounts of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances in the brain that help maintain mental balance.
Stomatocytes are red blood cells (rbcs) with an oval or rectangular area of central pallor, looking like a "mouth" on a stained blood smear differential.
The indentation on one side of the red cell is missing.
Stomatocytes usually have altered permeability and increased cell volume.
Stomatocytes tend to get trapped in the spleen and other organs, resulting in hemolysis.
40-60% of rbcs may be stomatocytes in patients with hereditary stomatocytosis.
Increased numbers of stomatocytes are seen with liver disease, electrolyte imbalance, and hereditary stomatocytosis.
Stomatocytes may also be seen as an artifact on a drying blood smear, but they should only be seen on some areas on the periphery of the blood smear.
The avian reovirus causes an important poultry disease.
The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, a direct infection of the kidney.
They may also be seen in inflammations, such as acute allergic interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis.

Sheep sorrel pollen can induce asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis
The MLYCD gene (malonyl-CoA decarboxylase) is located on chromosome 16q23.3.
The product of this gene catalyzes the breakdown of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide.
Malonyl-CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis, and also inhibits the transport of fatty acyl CoAs into mitochondria.
Consequently, the encoded protein acts to increase the rate of fatty acid oxidation.
It is found in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the cytoplasm.
Mutations in this gene result in malonyl-CoA decarboyxlase deficiency.
Corynebacteria are catalase producing, gram positive bacilli or coccobacilli.
In the past, the non-diphtherial corynebacteria were believed to be contaminants in cultures, but now are recognized as the cause of significant disease, especially as opportunistic infections in patients who are immunocompromised, who have prosthetic devices, or who spend extended periods of time in nursing homes or hospitals.
The most significant species of Corynebacterium is C diphtheria which is the bacteria that causes diphtheria.
Diphtheria has been eradicated from most developed countries due to the implementation of universal vaccination against the primary virulence factor of diphtheria which is the diphtheria toxin (DT).
There are 88 species of Corynebacterium, 53 of which cause occasional or extremely rare disease in humans or are transmitted by zoonotic exposure.
The remaining species have only been found in animals, birds, the environment, water, food, or synthetic material.
They have numerous metabolic properties including being fermentative, oxidative, assimilative, or nonreactive.
Corynebacterium can be identified by biochemical strips that compare chemical reactions to the chemical reactions of known organisms.
Other methods used to identify Corynebacterium include using gene sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF).
Butanone, better known as methyl ethyl ketone or MEK, is an organic compound with the formula CH3C(O)CH2CH3.

3-Methylglutaconic acid is a glutarate which builds up in the urine in 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria or 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria.
Paper wasps are wasps of the family Vespidae, in the strict sense those belonging to the subfamily Polistinae, but the term is used colloquially to include some members of the subfamilies Vespinae and Stenogastrinae which also make nests out of paper.
The wasps gather fibres from old wood and dry dead plant stems, chew them, and mix with saliva to make a water-resistant gray or brown paper.
The nests of most true paper wasps are characterised by having open cells and a petiole attaching the nest to the substrate, or place where it is attached.
The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants, and they secrete it around the base of this petiole in order to avoid letting their brood become ant food.
Despite the use of the proper name, most social wasps make nests from paper, although some tropical wasp species, such as Liostenogaster flavolineata, use mud, a far easier resource for the wasp to collect.
Dechlorane is a white, stable odorless, synthetic, crystalline solid organochlorine insecticide and fire- retardant.
As an insecticide, dechlorane was used to kill fire ants.
When it was discovered to be a bioaccumulative pollutant in 1976, it was banned from use in the United States.
As a fire-retardant, dechlorane was added to plastics, paint, rubber, paper, and electrical appliances.
Symptoms of exposure to dechlorane can irritate the skin and eyes, cause headaches and dizziness, and nausea and vomiting.
In addition, dechlorane can adversely affect the central nervous system, lungs, liver and kidneys.
Dechlorane is also carcinogenic.
Medical diagnoses or clinical conditions the patient has at the time of the encounter that may or may not be associated with the primary or any other reason for the encounter.
The soybean (U.S. and UK) or soya bean (UK) (Glycine max) is a species of legume native to Eastern Asia.
It is an annual plant that may vary in growth habit and height.
It may grow prostrate, not growing higher than 20 cm (7.8 inches), or even stiffly erect up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in height.
The pods, stems, and leaves are covered with fine brown or gray pubescence.
The leaves are trifoliate (sometimes with 5 leaflets), and the leaflets are 6-15 cm (2-6 inches) long and 2-7 cm (1-3 inches) broad; they fall before the seeds are mature.
The small, inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are either white or purple.
The fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of 3-5, with each pod 3-8 cm (1-3 inches) long and usually containing 2-4 (rarely more) seeds 5-11 mm in diameter.
Like corn and some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty.
3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate (DOPAC) is a metabolite of dopamine via the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme.

Grape has been reported to cause oral allergy syndrome, exercised induced asthma and anaphylaxis.
The etiology has been confirmed with skin prick testing, specific IgE and challenge tests (1-3).
Patients who complain of symptoms suggesting anaphylaxis should be tested for grapes (1).
In oncology, AFP-L3 is an isoform of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a substance typically used in the triple test during pregnancy and for screening chronic liver disease patients for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
AFP can be fractionated by affinity electrophoresis into 3 glycoforms: L1, L2, and L3 based on the reactivity with the lectin Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA).
AFP-L3 binds strongly to LCA via an additional Î± 1-6 fucose residue attached at the reducing terminus of N-acetylglucosamine; this is in contrast to the L1 isoform.
It is the L1 isoform which is typically associated with non-HCC inflammation of liver disease condition.
The L3 isoform is specific to malignant tumors and its detected presence can serve to identify patients whom need increased monitoring for the development of HCC in high risk populations (i.e. chronic hepatitis B & C and/or liver cirrhosis).
AFP-L3% is now being considered as a tumor marker for the North American demographic.

Edible Onions are not known in the wild, but are grown only in cultivated beds.
The bulb can be eaten raw in salads, sandwich fillings, etc., or cooked or preserved in a variety of ways.
Fresh, dried, pickled, canned or even frozen, it is the most common flavouring in many cuisines.
The leaves, flowers and sprouted seeds are also eaten.
Onion can induce symptoms of food allergy, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and contact dermatitis in sensitised individuals.
Onion is one of the commonest causes of contact dermatitis of the hands.
Hemoglobin Barts consists of four gamma chains.
It is moderately insoluble, and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells.
It has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, resulting in almost no oxygen delivery to the tissues.
It is produced in the disease alpha-thalassemia and in the most severe of cases, it is the only form of haemoglobin in circulation.
In this situation, a fetus will develop hydrops fetalis and normally die before or shortly after birth, unless intrauterine blood transfusion is performed.
Since Hemoglobin Barts is elevated in alpha thalassaemia, it can be measured, providing a useful screening test for this disease in some populations.
The ALDOB gene (aldolase B, fructose-bisphosphate) is located on chromosome 9q21.3-q22.2.
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is a tetrameric glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
Vertebrates have 3 aldolase isozymes which are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties.
Differences indicate that aldolases A, B, and C are distinct proteins, the products of a family of related 'housekeeping' genes exhibiting developmentally regulated expression of the different isozymes.
The developing embryo produces aldolase A, which is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle where it can be as much as 5% of total cellular protein.
In adult liver, kidney and intestine, aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced.
In brain and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally.
There is a high degree of homology between aldolase A and C. Defects in ALDOB cause hereditary fructose intolerance.
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of the body.
This disorder was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome (MPS I-H), Hurler-Scheie syndrome (MPS I-H/S), and Scheie syndrome (MPS I-S), listed from most to least severe.
Because there is so much overlap between each of these three syndromes, MPS I is currently divided into the severe and attenuated types.
Mutations in the IDUA gene cause MPS I.
The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
GAGs were originally called mucopolysaccharides, which is where this condition gets its name.
Mutations in the IDUA gene reduce or completely eliminate the function of the IDUA enzyme.
The lack of IDUA enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within cells, specifically inside the lysosomes.
Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle different types of molecules.
Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes, including MPS I, are called lysosomal storage disorders.
The accumulation of GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder.
This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.
The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

There is a need to differentiate between Rye the foodstuff (Secale cereale), Cultivated Rye grass pollen (Secale cereale) g12, Rye grass pollen (Lolium perenne) g5, and Wild Rye grass pollen (Elymus tricoides) g70.
This distantly related genus, Elymus, contains species known as Wild Ryes, which are used as cover and for forage.
A Wheat hybrid is known as Giant Rye.
Rye and Rye flour may commonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals, in particular in bakers.
Symptoms may include asthma, rhinitis, sneezing and wheezing.
Food allergy with gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastric irritation, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, has been reported.
Cutaneous symptoms may include pruritis, urticaria, dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and angioedema.
Anaphylaxis or vascular collapse with exercise has been documented.
Basophils are the least common of the granulocytes, representing about 0.5% to 1% of circulating white blood cells.
They contain large cytoplasmic granules which partially hide the cell nucleus when examined under the microscope.
However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has 2 lobes.
A cell in tissues, the mast cell, has many similar characteristics.
For example, both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated in certain ways (histamine causes some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction).
Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils can be recruited out of the blood into a tissue when needed.
When activated, basophils secrete histamine, several proteoglycans, lipid mediators like leukotrienes, and several cytokines.
Histamine and proteoglycans are pre-stored in the cell's granules whereas the other secreted substances are newly synthesized.
Each of these substances contributes to inflammation.
Biochemical precursor substance from which the body synthesizes endomorphis.
Thyroid hormone uptake ("T-uptake") assays provide information on the number of thyroid hormone binding sites, consisting primarily of thyroid binding globulin, thyroxine binding prealbumin and albumin.
Since both T4 and T3 bind to these proteins, different assay formats have used either labeled T3 or T4 (the classic T3 resin uptake uses T3).
Various T-uptake assays can differ in the units reported (and even the phenomena being measured), requiring mindfulness when selecting LOINC codes.
Being used in the calculation of free T3 and free T4 index (FTI), the T-uptake variants also proliferate into variants of FTI.
The classic T-uptake reported as % represents the proportion of labeled thyroid hormone (either T3 or T4) added to a sample that remains unbound (modern assays: use LOINC 74793-1; T3 resin uptake method: 3050-2).
T-uptake reported as ratio of patient /control is known as thyroid hormone binding ratio, or THBR or T-uptake ratio (use LOINC 74794-9).
T-uptake % and THBR generally are inversely proportional to the number of unoccupied thyroid hormone binding sites present.
Alternative assay methods that report T-uptake as "T-uptake units" are described as being directly proportional to the total binding capacity (use LOINC 74795-6).
However, the major rationale for measuring the T-Uptake was to obtain a factor for estimating the free T4 (the biologically relevant fraction).
Now that Free T4 measures are widely available, accurate and more economical than measuring a T-uptake AND a TT4, use of the uptake has been discouraged by most experts.
Canada has taken the position of not paying for T-uptake measures.
Horse allergy occurs among people who regularly handle horses, either professionally or for recreational purposes, resulting in the induction or exacerbation of asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and occupational asthma.
Horse allergy has also been reported to result in angioedema, respiratory distress, and poorly controlled asthma.
Malus domestica recombinant Mal d 4 is a member of the profilin family of allergens and associated with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) to apple.
It is a homologous protein to Bet v 2, which has been identified as a minor pollen sensitizer in approximately 10-30% of pollen-allergic individuals.
As with other profilins, Mal d 4 is highly thermolabile and rapidly enzyme degradable, accounting for its inability to elicit systemic reaction and its loss of allergenicity in cooked foods.
Primary sensitization to Mal d 4 develops through pollinosis and cross-reactivity to Bet v 2, and is not presumed to arise directly from apple ingestion without previous sensitization to birch or grass profilin.
Veterinary Medicine: Sulfadimethoxine is a long-acting sulfonamide antibiotic that is used to treat skin and soft tissue infections caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, and Proteus mirabilis.
When used in a 5 to 1 ratio with the antibiotic Ormetoprim, the combination increases the strength of Sulfadimethoxine's properties of fighting infection and reduces the resistance rate the bacteria might have against the antibiotic by blocking the bacteria's metabolism of folic acid, depriving the bacteria of folate coenzymes.
Some fungi are called yeast-like because they exist as a yeast for part of their life cycle, but can be hyphal for a significant portion of it.

Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are partially man-made fats generally made by processing coconut and palm kernel oils in the laboratory.
"Medium" refers to the chain length of the fatty acids.
Oils can contain short chain, medium chain, or long chain fatty acids and most oils are a combination of all three types.
Medium chain fatty acids contain between 6 and 12 carbon chains.
They are: C6 caproic acid, C8 caprylic acid, C10 capric acid, and C12 lauric acid.
MCTs passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system without requirement for modification like long-chain fatty acids or very-long-chain fatty acids.
MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion.
Patients who have malnutrition, malabsorption or particular fatty-acid metabolism disorders are treated with MCTs, as MCTs do not require energy for absorption, use, or storage.
They have potentially beneficial attributes in protein metabolism, but may be contraindicated in some situations due to a reported tendency to induce ketogenesis and metabolic acidosis.

Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p- or 5p minus syndrome) is caused by a deletion of the end of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5.
The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals; studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and developmental delay than smaller deletions.
The signs and symptoms of cri-du-chat syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 5.
Studies also show that the loss of a specific gene, CTNND2, is associated with severe intellectual disability in some people with this condition.
Most cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited; the deletion occurs as a random or de novo event.
About 10 percent of patients with 5p- inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent who carries a balance chromosomal translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost.

Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment produced by the normal breakdown of heme, a component of the hemoglobin found in red blood cells.
It is processed by the liver and excreted in bile.
Conditions that cause red blood cell breakdown or interfere with liver or bile processing can cause elevated levels of bilirubin.
Bilirubin exists in many forms.
Non-glucuronidated bilirubin (also called unconjugated or indirect) is the breakdown product of heme and is not water-soluble.
Hemolytic anemias, which cause increased red blood cell breakdown, are one cause of elevated non-glucuronidated bilirubin.
Glucuronidated bilirubin (also called conjugated) is a water-soluble form of bilirubin that is made in the liver by the addition of sugar molecules to non-glucuronidated bilirubin.
Conditions that affect liver function (such as hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver tumors) or physically block the bile ducts (such as gallstones) can cause elevated levels of glucuronidated bilirubin.
A third form of bilirubin is that which is bound to albumin, and it is also known as delta bilirubin because it was originally identified based on the unexpected difference between the total bilirubin level and the level of glucuronidated plus non-glucuronidated bilirubin in some patient samples.
Prior to the discovery of albumin-bound bilirubin, the term "direct" bilirubin was used as a synonym for glucuronidated bilirubin, but direct bilirubin is actually glucuronidated plus delta bilirubin (bilirubin covalently bound to albumin).

Neurons (also known as neurones, nerve cells and nerve fibers) are a major class of cells (parenchyma) in the nervous system whose main role is to process and transmit information.
In vertebrate animals, neurons are found in the brain, the spinal cord and in the nerves and ganglia of the peripheral nervous system.
Neurons are typically composed of a cell body, a dendritic tree and an axon.
In the classic view of neuron function, the cell body and dendritic tree receive electrical signals from other neurons while the axon transmits electrical output signals.
Neurons are able to generate and propagate electrical impulses because they have excitable membranes.
Neurons make connections with other neurons and transmit information to them via synaptic transmission.
Different types of neurons have different shapes, possess specific electrical properties adopted for their function and use different neurotransmitters.

Myelin is a modified plasma membrane that is wrapped in a spiral around the nerve axon creating a sheath.
The myelin sheath is comprised of abundant amounts of lipids and proteins and functions to insulate and protect the axon, and speed up nerve signal transmission.
Myelin covers the axons in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
The myelin in CNS is produced by the oligodendrocytes and the myelin in the PNS is produced by the Schwann cells.
In multiple sclerosis, a disease where myelin is lost or damaged, only the CNS myelin is affected.
The two types are myelin are chemically distinct but accomplish the same goal to promote efficient signal transmission and protect the axon.
In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath in the CNS, damaging it and the oligodendrocytes that produce it.
The resulting lesions and scars are detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing nerve impulses to slow down or stop completely, and leading to the symptoms of MS.

CVA7 is most closely related to CVA14, CVA16, and Enterovirus 71 (EV71), and is associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD).
CVA7 is neurotropic and can cause paralytic poliomyelitis.
CVA7 was widely detected in the 1950s and 1960s during paralytic epidemics.
Two forms of placental alkaline phopsphatases (P-ALP) exist: P1 (the major form) and P2 (the minor form P2), representing about 90% and 10%, respectively.
In pregnancy, P-ALP is first detected between the sixteenth and twentieth week of gestation.
It increases gradually until delivery and usually disappears within four to seven days post-partum.
P-ALP is also found in some malignant diseases, including ovarian cancers, sarcomas, pancreatic and stomach cancers.

A spice mixture, which may result in allergy symptoms in sensitised individuals.
The term "Curry" can be very confusing, as its meanings range from the name of several plants to the generic name of a considerable variety of spice mixtures and whole dishes.
Spices may uncommonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Symptoms are usually mild but vary from itching and smarting of the lips and mouth to anaphylaxis.
Most allergic reactions produced by spices are the result of ingestion, and spices usually act as "hidden" allergens.
Spices as hidden allergens are potentially very dangerous because minute amounts can cause systemic reactions and even anaphylactic shock.

The term is named "sphere" to indicate that the correction is applied in all meridians of the eye.
Monocyte distribution width (MDW) is the measure of a change in the size distribution of circulating monocytes.
An increase in the MDW may be an early indicator of sepsis.
An early diagnosis of sepsis in patients has been a challenge, with the time to diagnosis often being more than 8 hours after the patient arrives in the ED.
An elevated white blood cell (WBC) count is not a specific marker for sepsis, and a better measure may be the WBC in conjunction with the MDW, because monocytes are early responders to pathogenic organisms and their immune response causes them to increase in size.
Some indications reduce the efficacy of the MDW in helping to diagnose sepsis and include vitamin deficiencies, primary bone marrow disorders, some drugs that lead to macrocytosis, and immune suppressed individuals and more.
Dirithromycin is a macrolide glycopeptide antibiotic.
Dirithromycin (Dynabac) is a more lipid-soluble prodrug derivative of 9S-erythromycyclamine prepared by condensation of the latter with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde.

Xanthochromia refers to the yellowish appearance of cerebrospinal fluid in certain medical conditions, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, when red blood cells (RBC) enter the CSF during bleeding.
RBCs are eventually destroyed, releasing the oxygen-carrying molecule heme, which in turn is degraded to yield bilirubin, a yellow-green pigment.
Heme that enters the CSF for different reasons (for example when a small blood vessel is damaged during a lumbar puncture), has no time to be digested and bilirubin is not generated.
Many laboratories rely on the color of the fluid alone when testing for xanthochromia.
Recent guidelines, however, suggest that spectrophotometry should be performed since bilirubin absorbs light of wavelengths between 450-460 nm.
Two related substances, oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin (410-418 nm and 403-410 nm absorption ranges, respectively) that are also released when heme is metabolized may be detected during this process.
There are other causes for xanthochromia.

The ACTH stimulation test (also called the cosyntropin test, tetracosactide test or Synacthen test) is a medical test usually ordered and interpreted by endocrinologists to assess the functioning of the adrenal glands stress response by measuring the adrenal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
ACTH is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol.
During the test, a small amount of synthetic ACTH is injected, and the amount of cortisol, and sometimes aldosterone, the adrenals produce in response is measured.
This test may cause mild to moderate side effects in some individuals.
This test is used to diagnose or exclude primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease and related conditions.
In addition to quantifying adrenal insufficiency, the test can distinguish whether the cause is adrenal (low cortisol and aldosterone production) or pituitary (low ACTH production).
The ACTH stimulation test is recognized as the gold standard assay of adrenal insufficiency, although this test is primarily used to determine the presence of Addison's disease and pituitary impairment.
If the test does not show Addison's, the test interpreter may see it as showing the adrenal glands are working, not recognizing any degree of adrenal insufficiency between Addison's (the worst degree of adrenal insufficiency) and healthy adrenal function.
The test is extremely sensitive (97% at 95% specificity) to primary adrenal insufficiency, but less so to secondary adrenal insufficiency (57-61% at 95% specificity); while secondary adrenal insufficiency may thus be dismissed by some interpreters on the basis of the test, additional testing may be called for if probability of secondary adrenal insufficiency is particularly high.
Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening condition.
Treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, or sooner if the patient presents in apparent adrenal crisis
The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are polypeptides with high sequence similarity to insulin.

It has a hairy, dull green-brown skin that most people peel off before consumption.
The flesh is bright green or golden with rows of small, black, edible seeds.
The texture of the fruit is soft and the flavour is sometimes described as a mix of strawberry, banana, and pineapple.
The fruit gets its name from a marketing strategy, naming it after the kiwi, the national bird of New Zealand, where the fruit was first commercially popularised in 1959 by the New Zealand fruit-and-vegetable export company Turners and Growers ; previously it was known as the Chinese gooseberry, but due to the Cold War, the Chinese label seemed unfit for popularization of the fruit in Western countries.

The LAMC2 gene (laminin subunit gamma 2) is located on chromosome 1q25-q31.
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes.
They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis.
Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), have a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains.
Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene.
Several isoforms of each chain have been described.
Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1.
The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo.
This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 2.
The gamma 2 chain, formerly thought to be a truncated version of beta chain (B2t), is highly homologous to the gamma 1 chain; however, it lacks domain VI, and domains V, IV and III are shorter.
It is expressed in several fetal tissues but differently from gamma 1, and is specifically localized to epithelial cells in skin, lung and kidney.
The gamma 2 chain together with alpha 3 and beta 3 chains constitute laminin 5 (earlier known as kalinin), which is an integral part of the anchoring filaments that connect epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane.
The epithelium-specific expression of the gamma 2 chain implied its role as an epithelium attachment molecule, and mutations in this gene have been associated with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a skin disease characterized by blisters due to disruption of the epidermal-dermal junction.
Two transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing of the 3' terminal exon, and encoding different isoforms of gamma 2 chain, have been described.
The two variants are differentially expressed in embryonic tissues, however, the biological significance of the two forms is not known.
Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyA_signal have also been noted in literature.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, or also called LD) is an oxidoreductase (LD: and is the most important clinically of several dehydrogenases occurring in human serum.
LDH catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD.
When disease, injury, or toxic material damages tissues, cells release LDH into the bloodstream.
Since LDH is a fairly stable enzyme, it has been widely used to evaluate the presence of damage and toxicity of tissue and cells.
LDH is cytoplasmic in its cellular location and in any one tissue is composed of one or two of five possible isoenzymes.
While many of its clinical applications involve quantification of one or more specific serum isoenzymes, an estimate of total LDH is usually required.
Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible reaction: L-lactate + NAD <--> pyruvate + NADH.
Testing methods either measure the increase in NADH produced in the lactate-to-pyruvate reaction or the decrease in NADH produced in the pyruvate-to-lactate reaction..
Reference ranges are highly method dependent.
The pyruvate-to-lactate reaction is preferred theoretically because the equilibrium constant is large and the rate for any amount of enzyme is 2-3 times faster, thus smaller sample and shorter observation periods are needed.
Disadvantages of the pyruvate-to-lactate reaction are loss of linearity as compared with the lactate-to-pyruvate reaction, and greater substrate inhibition of the enzyme.

Angelman syndrome risk refers to the fetus's risk of having Angelman syndrome.
The risk for the fetus can be derived from the general population risk as well as prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.Angelman syndrome is primarily caused by the functional loss of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15.
In certain areas of the brain, only the maternal copy of this gene is active due to genomic imprinting, and in Angelman syndrome, the maternal copy is missing.
The genetic basis for Angelman syndrome is the inverse of the basis for Prader-Willi syndrome, in which the paternal copy of certain genes on chromosome 15 are missing.
About 70% of cases are due to the deletion of a portion of the maternal chromosome 15, and another 11% are due to a mutation in the maternal copy of UBE3A. Cases may also be due to the presence of two paternal chromosome 15 copies (called uniparental disomy, meaning two copies from one parent) instead of one maternal and one paternal, chromosomal translocation, or abnormal inactivation of genes on maternal chromosome 15.
In 10 to 15% of cases, the cause is unknown.
Angelman syndrome is associated with cognitive delay, seizure disorder, speech impairment, and microcephaly.
Children with Angelman syndrome exhibit a happy appearance with frequent smiling, laughing, and hand-flapping, as well as hyperactivity and short attention span.
The general population risk of Angelman syndrome is about 1 in 12,000 - 20,000 live births, and does not change with maternal age.
Î²-Sitosterol is one of several phytosterols (plant sterols) with chemical structures similar to that of cholesterol.

Neutrophils are white blood cells that are critical to the healthy function of the immune system.
They are drawn to sites of infection and injury to phagocytose and digest microbes.
Neutrophils rely on their ability to generate an oxidative burst to effectively kill microorganisms.
The oxidative burst is a series of reactions involving NADPH oxidase that is triggered by receptors when they encounter bacterial peptides such as N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and which results in the production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen species (ROS).
The inability of neutrophils to create an oxidative burst can lead to a decreased ability to fight infection.
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an x-linked or autosomal-recessive disorder where NADPH oxidase is improperly assembled which leads to an inadequate oxidative burst response and increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections.
One method of assessing neutrophil function uses flow cytometry to measure the fluorescence of neutrophils that have been stimulated in the presence of the nonfluorescent dye dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123), which, when oxidized, produces the fluorescent compound rhodamine 123.
Both the percent of neutrophils having a burst response and the efficacy of that response as reflected by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is measured.
Depending on the underlying genetic cause and severity of CGD, some patients have a population of neutrophils that can generate a burst response but with lower MFI compared to healthy controls, while others only have neutrophils that are not capable of generating a response at all.

It belongs to the steroid hormone receptor family where the ligand diffuses into cells, interacts with the receptor and results in a signal transduction affecting specific gene expression in the nucleus.
Platelets are miniature fragments of cytoplasm that break off of megakaryocytes.
Their primary function is to inhibit excessive hemorrhage after blood vessel injury.
Platelets cling to the damaged part of the blood vessel where they become activated, recruit other platelets to the site, and begin the cascade of physical and chemical events that lead to clot formation.
Activated platelets secrete cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, all which play a role in thrombus development.
When activated, platelets stimulate monocytes and neutrophils to leave the blood vessel and enter the tissue.
The normal range of platelets is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets/uL. Lower than normal platelet counts can lead to increased bleeding and is caused by a number of factors including: chemotherapy, autoimmune disorders and some medications.
Increased platelets can cause hypercoagulation due to cancer, anemia, spleen removal and some medications.

The F5 gene (coagulation factor V (proaccelerin, labile factor)) is located on chromosome 1q23.
This gene encodes an essential cofactor of the blood coagulation cascade.
This factor circulates in plasma, and is converted to the active form by the release of the activation peptide by thrombin during coagulation.
This generates a heavy chain and a light chain which are held together by calcium ions.
The activated protein is a cofactor that participates with activated coagulation factor X to activate prothrombin to thrombin.
Defects in this gene result in either an autosomal recessive hemorrhagic diathesis or an autosomal dominant form of thrombophilia, which is known as activated protein C resistance.

During systole, the radial wall thickens.
Radial strain is related to stroke volume.
Sensitivity of peak radial systolic strain to changes in contractile state and loading conditions using two-dimensional images has been well documented.
Significantly low radial peak systolic strain and strain rate values have been found in patients with acute rejection â¥ grade 1B.
Among patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes â¥ grade 3, there was a significant reduction in diastolic radial, circumferential and longitudinal global peak strain and strain rate value in comparison to values before rejection.
A sudden drop of â¥ 15% of the radial global strain rate in heart transplant patients appeared highly predictive for acute biopsy proven rejection.
The F8 gene (coagulation factor VIII, procoagulant component) is located on chromosome Xq28.
This gene encodes coagulation factor VIII, which participates in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation; factor VIII is a cofactor for factor IXa which, in the presence of Ca+2 and phospholipids, converts factor X to the activated form Xa.
This gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts.
Transcript variant 1 encodes a large glycoprotein, isoform a, which circulates in plasma and associates with von Willebrand factor in a noncovalent complex.
This protein undergoes multiple cleavage events.
Transcript variant 2 encodes a putative small protein, isoform b, which consists primarily of the phospholipid binding domain of factor VIIIc.
This binding domain is essential for coagulant activity.
Defects in this gene results in hemophilia A, a common recessive X-linked coagulation disorder.

The PSEN1 gene (presenilin 1) is located on chromosome 14q24.3.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or in the amyloid precursor protein (APP).
These disease-linked mutations result in increased production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits found in AD brains).
Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP.
Also, it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch receptor, such that they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity or themselves are protease enzymes.
Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene, the full-length nature of only some have been determined.

Glutamine, (L-glutamine) is an amino acide traditionally considered nonessential, however it may be considered "conditionally essential" after critical illness, stress, or injury.
(Glutamine is different than glutamate (glutamic acid), monosodium glutamate, and gluten.)
It is the most abundant free amino acid in human muscle and plasma, and is important as a constituent of proteins and as a means of nitrogen transport between tissues.
Muscle is the major tissue involved in glutamine synthesis.
Glutamine is utilized at high rates by leukocytes (particularly lymphocytes) to provide energy and optimal conditions for nucleotide biosynthesis, and therefore cell proliferation metabolic requirements.
In times of stress (illness or prolonged exercise for example) there is an associated decrease in the intramuscular and plasma concentrations of glutamine, and it has been hypothesized that this decrease in glutamine availability could impair immune function.
Dietary sources of glutamine include plant and animal proteins such as beef, pork, poultry, milk, yogurt, ricotta cheese, cottage cheese, raw spinach, raw parsley, and cabbage.

The human papilloma viruses (HPVs) belong to the family Papillomaviridae, which are small, nonenveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses.
The HPV genome includes DNA sequences for six early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and two late (L1 and L2) proteins.
There are more than 100 types of HPV.
The viruses can be classified into high and low risk types based on their ability to cause cancer.
HPV is most often transmitted sexually but has been know to spread during nonsexual encounters and even rarely through fomites.
At least 40 HPV types can infect the genital area.
Most sexually active persons become infected with HPV at least once.
HPV types 16 and 18 are oncogenic, high risk and cause most cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers.
Non oncogenic, low-risk HPV types (e.g., 6, 11) cause genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
Since subclinical genital HPV infection generally clears spontaneously, treatment is only directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) or pathologic HPV-caused precancerous lesions.
Cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated cancer for which routine screening is recommended.
Vaccines are available to protect against oncogenic as well as common nononcogenic types.

Uses of thiosulfates include the dissolving of silver salts from photographic film.
Changes in the CSF, plasma and urine levels of beta alanine, beta aminoisobutyrate (BAIB) and gamma aminobutyrate (GABA) may help identify certain metabolic disorders.
Beta alanine is a structural analogue of GABA and may also function as a neurotransmitter since it is both a glycine and GABAA receptor agonist.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the first enzyme in the pyrimidine degradation pathway, in which uracil and thymine are catabolized to beta alanine and R-BAIB, respectively.
The S enantiomer of BAIB (S-BAIB) is derived from valine catabolism.
Under normal circumstances, urine contains predominantly R-BAIB (from thymine) because it is eliminated by filtration and tubular secretion, while plasma contains about 80% S-BAIB (from valine), which is reabsorbed in the kidneys.
In patients with a DPD deficiency, uracil and thymine catabolism is decreased.
This results in mildly decreased plasma and urine concentrations and normal CSF concentration of beta alanine, and moderately decreased CSF concentration and markedly decreased plasma concentration of BAIB.
On the other hand, urine BAIB is elevated, which indicates that there must be cross-over in the thymine and valine degradation pathways.
Hemoglobin A1c refers to hemoglobin components formed by interaction of hemoglobin with glucose.
This interaction is a non-enzymatic irreversible process that is dependent on glucose concentration.
RBC half-life is approx 120 days so a measurement can yield the average glucose concentration over the last 8 to 12 weeks.
Orciprenaline (INN, also known as metaproterenol) is a bronchodilator used in the treatment of asthma.
Orciprenaline is a moderately selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors.
The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP.
Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from many cells, especially from mast cells.
The MRPL40 gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L40) is located on chromosome 22q11.2.
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion.
Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit.
They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed.
Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA.
Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.
This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein.
Deletions in this gene may contribute to the etiology of velo-cardio-facial syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome.

The B lymphocytes that are CD27+IgD+IgM+, also known as non-switched memory B cells, are lymphocytes whose function and origin in normal patients is unresolved.
They are described as non-switched because they are IgD+IgM+ and as memory cells because they are CD27+.
This subset of B cells has been found to be reduced in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Increased levels of autoantibodies associated with SLE including ANA, anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA Ab correlate with a decreased level of CD27+IgD+IgM+ B lymphocytes.
Studies have also shown that CD27+IgD+IgM+ B lymphocytes exhibit increased auto-reactivity and activation functionality.
The level of CD27+IgD+IgM+ B lymphocytes remains reduced in patients with SLE even when they are in remission.

The Parechovirus belongs to the family Picornaviridae and is a small, nonenveloped RNA virus with icosahedral capsids.
There are two species of Parechovirus including Parechovirus A (HPeV), previously named Human parechovirus, and Parechovirus B, previously named Ljungan virus.
HPeV is made up of nineteen types designated as HPeV-1 to HPeV-19.
Human infection by HPeV occurs worldwide and is often asymptomatic.
Transmission of HPeV is by the fecal-oral route, respiratory secretions and fomites.
When symptoms occur, they usually consist of mild gastroenteritis and respiratory symptoms.
More serious disease has been attributed to HPeV-3, which can cause neonatal sepsis and aseptic meningitis in children.
In 9 out of 10 neonates infected with HPeV-3, there is white matter damage which can lead to cerebral palsy, epilepsy and learning disabilities.
There is no FDA approved anti-viral treatment for HPeV available, though there are some therapies in development that target viral capsid proteins, proteases and polymerase.

Inhibitor of Kappa Light Polypeptide Gene Enhancer in B Cells Gamma Kinase (IKBKG), also known as NF-Kappa-B Essential Modulator (NEMO), is a protein that is a subunit of the IÎºB kinase that activates NF-ÎºB, known as Inhibitor of kappa B Kinase (IKK).
The gene for IKBKG is located on chromosome Xq28.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Mutations in the IKBKG gene results in incontinentia pigmenti, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and several other types of immunodeficiencies.
Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant disease caused by a mutation in the IKBKG gene.
Since IKBKG helps activate NF-ÎºB, which protects cells against TNF-alpha induced apoptosis, a lack of IKBKG (and hence a lack of active NF-ÎºB) makes cells more prone to apoptosis.
Albumin is the protein of greatest concentration found in plasma consisting of approximately 55-60% of the serum protein.
Albumin has several functions; it provides the majority of the intravascular oncotic pressure and helps with the regulation of fluid concentrations in tissues.
It has a major role in binding and transport of endogenous substances and medications.
Albumin has antioxidant activity and may assist in wound healing, has a heparin-like anticoagulant effect, and acts as a buffer for acid-base homoestasis.
Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), where the metal binding capacity of albumin has deceased because of exposure to ischemic events, is a bio-marker of myocardial ischemia.
Changes in IMA levels have shown to appear during coronary angioplasty-induced ischemia.
IMA is an early test that can be combined with electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and cardiac troponin testing for the early exclusion of acute coronary syndrome.
How IMA forms and the precise entity measured are not fully known.
Ureaplasma urealyticum is a species of gram-negative bacteria found in the human genitourinary tract, oropharynx, and anal canal.
It may also be isolated from the urine of sexually active patients.
Sixty percent or more of all women who carry U. urealyticum in their genital tract are without symptoms.
U. urealyticum has been implicated in some cases of non-gonococcal urethritis.
CD42, platelet Glycoprotein Ib/V/IX complex(GPIb/V/IX).

Pseudoephedrine (commonly abbreviated as PSE) is a sympathomimetic amine commonly used as a decongestant.
The salts pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate are found in many over-the-counter preparations either as single-ingredient preparations, or more commonly in combination with antihistamines, paracetamol andor ibuprofen.
Consumers often refer to it by a product which contains pseudoephedrine, such as Sudafed, the trademark for a common brand of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in North America.
Unlike antihistamines, which modify the systemic histamine -mediated allergic response, pseudoephedrine only relieves nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies.
The advantage of oral pseudoephedrine over topical nasal preparations, such as oxymetazoline, is that it does not cause rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa); however, it is more likely to cause adverse effects including hypertension.
HPV type 16 and 18 are the most common carcinogenic HPV types.
HPV type 16 is detected in about 50% of invasive cervical cancers worldwide and is associated with a higher risk of a severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 3).
HPV type 16 is one of the greatest risks for HPV persistence along with increasing age, smoking, immunosuppression, inflammation, hormones, and genetic factors.
HPV type 18 is detected in 10% to 20% of invasive cervical cancers and more commonly found in adenocarcinomas compared to squamous-cell cervical carcinomas.
Pentazocine is a synthetically-prepared narcotic drug used to treat mild to moderate pain.
Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Talwin.
In the 1980s, recreational drug users discovered that combining pentazocine with the antihistamine tripellenamine (most commonly dispensed under the brand name Pyribenzamine) produced a euphoric sensation much like that brought on by heroin, and users who were already addicted to the latter often used this combination when heroin was unavailable to them.
Since tripellenamine tablets are typically blue in color, the pentazocinetripellenamine combination acquired the slang name Ts and blues.
After health-care professionals and drug-enforcement officials became aware of this scenario, the narcotic-antagonist naloxone was added to preparations containing pentazocine, and the reported incidence of its abuse has declined precipitously since.

Azithromycin is an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics.
Azithromycin (brand names Zithromax Â® in Italy; Zmax Â®; Sumamed Â®; Aztrin Â®) is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics, and is derived from erythromycin ; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl -substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered.
Azithromycin is used to treat certain bacterial infections, most often bacteria causing middle ear infections, tonsillitis, throat infections, laryngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and sinusitis.
It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infectious diseases, such as non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis.
Recent studies have also shown it to be effective against late-onset asthma, but these findings are controversial and not widely accepted as of yet.
Staphylococci, members of the family Micrococcaceae, are Gram-positive cocci that grow in irregular grape-like clusters.
Traditionally, Staphylococci are divided into two groups: coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS).
The coagulase-positive group includes the well-known pathogen S. aureus, whereas the coagulase-negative group includes a number of species that are known commensals on skin.
It is clear that even the CoNS are true pathogens, especially in patients with indwelling devices, and given their prevalence, are common causes of bacteremia.
S. aureus is known for causing a number of superficial skin infections (boils, furuncles, impetigo, etc), but it can also cause more serious infections, especially in immunosuppressed patients including pneumonia, deep abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and meningitis.
Multiple antibiotic resistance is increasingly common in both S. aureus and CoNS, with the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) able to reach epidemic levels.
A bridged-ring tetracyclic antidepressant that is both mechanistically and functionally similar to the tricyclic antidepressants, including side effects associated with its use.

Serologic testing usually relies upon the demonstration of antibodies to group-specific antigens.
Individual serotype specificity is seldom required.
A third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases.
The BRAF gene (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase) Val600Glu mutation is the most common BRAF mutation detected in human cancer and causes a conformational change in the BRAF protein's G-loop activation segment that makes it constitutively active and resistant to negative feedback signals.
The identification of this mutation and its effects have led to the creation of targeted therapeutics that inhibit BRAF activity and have been associated with short-term improvement, but long-term remission usually does not occur due to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.
However, the combination of BRAF inhibitors with other medications, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors, may improve outcomes.
BRAF mutations have been associated with a range of cancers, including malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thyroid cancer, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and multiple myeloma.

As with many other pharmaceuticals, ketamine is used extramedically as a recreational drug.
Ketamine is a chiral compound, with two distinct enantiomers.
Most pharmaceutical ketamine preparations are racemic, however reportedly some brands have (mostly undocumented) differences in enantiomeric proportions.
Barbiturates were first developed in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer and were widely distributed by the Farbwerke Fr Bayer and Co in 1904.
Barbiturates offered new treatment to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders profoundly improving their prognoses.
Barbiturates were also used to treat sleep disorders and were the first drugs to effectively treat epileptic seizures.
Due to safety concerns related to drug dependence and overdose and new safer psychoactive medications barbiturate use sharply declined in the 1950s.

3,4-Dihydroxybutyric acid is a normal human urinary metabolite that is excreted in increased concentration in patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency.
Normal adults excrete 0.37 +/- 0.15 (SD) mmoles of 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate per 24 hr.
The compound is also detectable in blood.
The renal clearance of this compound is roughly equal that of creatinine.
Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is an autoimmune disorder that is manifested by progressive central, peripheral and/or autonomic nervous system symptoms.
The neurological symptoms include encephalitis, autonomic failure, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, visual complaints and more.
The antibodies that attack the neural tissue develop in response to tumor cells.
The neoplasm may or may not be detectable using conventional imaging modalities.
Since PNS can be associated with multiple antibodies testing usually includes a panel of PNS antibodies.
In addition, the different PNS antibodies are associated with certain cancers so the antibody pattern can assist in identifying the specific tumor if it was previously undiagnosed.
Of patients positive for the zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 4 (Zic4) antibodies, ninety-two percent were diagnosed with small cell lung cancer.
Zic4 antibodies often occur concurrently with Hu and CRMP5 antibodies.
The BRCA1 gene (breast cancer 1, early onset) is located on chromosome 17 at position q21, and the BRCA2 gene (breast cancer 2, early onset) is located on chromosome 13 at position q12.3.
Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers.
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair.
Angioplasty is the mechanical alteration of a narrowed or totally obstructed vascular lumen, generally caused by atheroma (the lesion of atherosclerosis).
The term derives from the roots Angio or vessel and plasticos fit for molding.
The term has come to include all manner of vascular interventions typically performed in a minimally invasive or percutaneous method.
See also Sheldoectomy Most commonly, the Seldinger technique is used to cannulate a blood vessel for access.
A guiding catheter is introduced into the arterial (or venous) system and advanced through the system to the location of an obstruction.
This in turn is followed by introduction of a guidewire which is advanced though the guide catheter, through the obstruction and extended into the blood vessel lumen beyond the obstruction.
Over the guidewire, a balloon catheter is advanced through both the guide catheter and the obstruction.
Direct or indirect contact with animal allergens frequently causes sensitisation.

Ficus benjamina, commonly known as the Weeping Fig or Benjamin's Fig and often sold in stores as just a "Ficus", is a species of fig tree, native to south and southeast Asia and Australia.
Alanine transaminase or ALT is an enzyme also called serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT).
It is found in serum and in various bodily tissues, but is most commonly associated with the liver.
It catalyzes the two parts of the alanine cycle.
It is commonly measured clinically as a part of a diagnostic evaluation of liver health.
Significantly elevated levels of ALT often suggest the existence of other medical problems such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, bile duct problems, infectious mononucleosis, or myopathy.
However, elevated levels of ALT do not automatically mean that medical problems exist.
Fluctuation of ALT levels is normal over the course of the day, and ALT levels can also increase in response to strenuous physical exercise.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is the first component enzyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contributes to transforming pyruvate into acetyl-CoA by a process called pyruvate decarboxylation.
Acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, so pyruvate dehydrogenase contributes to linking the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle and releasing energy via NADH..
Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an autoantigen recognized in primary biliary cirrhosis, a form of acute liver failure.
These antibodies appear to recognize oxidized protein that has resulted from inflammatory immune responses.
Some of these inflammatory responses are explained by gluten sensitivity.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency is a congenital degenerative metabolic disease resulting from a mutation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) located on the X chromosome.
Although defects have been identified in all 3 enzymes of the complex, the E1-Î± subunit is predominantly the culprit.
Malfunction of the citric acid cycle due to PDH deficiency deprives the body of energy and leads to an abnormal buildup of lactate.
PDH deficiency is a common cause of lactic acidosis in newborns and often presents with severe lethargy, poor feeding, tachypnea, and cases of death have occurred.
A highly poisonous compound used widely in the manufacture of plastics, adhesives and synthetic rubber.
Broad casts are small mucoprotein tube-shaped structures that are much wider than ordinary casts and indicate localized tubule damage.
As with any cast, broad casts are due to stasis in the distal collecting tubules, but broad casts are formed in the larger tubules.
They vary, are heterogeneous, and sometimes are referred to as "renal failure casts".
This is incorrect, however, because the kidney could recover or only part of the kidney could be involved.

This fungus shold be considered allergenic, but does not cause toxic or invasive diseases.
Molecular cloning of Bla g 1 has demonstrated a high homology with the major American cockroach allergen Per a 1, as well as with a mosquito protein involved in digestion (ANG12 precursor).
High levels of Bla g 1 were found in Cockroach hindgut and proventriculus.
Bla g 1 protein has also been reported to be most prevalent in the midgut.
Although Bla g 1 is produced by both sexes and all life stages of the German cockroach, adult females produce and excrete significantly more Bla g 1 in their faeces than males or nymphs, even proportionally to body mass or mass of voided faeces.
The concentration of Bla g 1 in faeces of adult females is 6- to 7- and 30-fold higher than in adult males and nymphs, respectively, probably because adult females process more food than do other German cockroaches
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito which was first identified in a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947.
Since 2014 it has spread explosively in the Americas where it has infected hundreds of thousands of people.
About 80% of those infected are asymptomatic.
Common symptoms include fever, headache, rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis.
Since the end of 2015, there has been an increase in ZIKV-associated cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and a tremendous increase in cases of microcephaly in fetuses and newborns in Brazil, raising worldwide public health concern.
Recent predictions are that the mosquito species A. Albopictus, which can hibernate and survive cool temperatures, will carry ZIKV to more temperate areas of North America, Australia and Southern Europe.
It is still not clear whether ZIKV in humans increases viral titers enough to trigger a new cycle when an infected person is bitten by a naÃ¯ve mosquito.
Direct human-to-human transmission has been documented to occur perinatally, sexually (primarily through semen), through breastfeeding, blood transfusion and through occupational transmission in the laboratory setting.
There are currently no specific anti-viral agents, vaccination or medical prophylaxis available.
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis.
Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, food, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation.
The first occurs in the liver and converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcidiol.
The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcitriol.
Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany.
It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen.
Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis.
Very few foods contain vitamin D. The flesh of fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are among the best sources.
Lawsonia intracellularis is a small, intracellular, gram negative rod bacteria which causes proliferative enteropathy in pigs.
Proliferative enteropathy is a thickening of the intestinal epithelium from the proliferation of enterocytes (cells of the intestinal lining).
The disease is endemic in swine and has also been reported in other species such as equine where outbreaks have been reported worldwide in foals since 2009.
The two main clinical presentations of proliferative enteropathy are porcine intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), which affects pigs that are 6-20 weeks old, and proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy (PHE), which affects 4-12 month olds.
Severe PIA can lead to necrotizing enteritis with coagulative necrosis of the adenomatous mucosa.
A potential target when testing for Lawsonia intracellularis RNA is the 16s ribosomal RNA gene.
Fraxinus is a genus of about 65 species, which are distributed in northern temperate regions.

Norcodeine is one of several metabolites of codeine which is an opiate derived from the poppy plant Papaver somniferum.
Most of codeine is metabolized in the liver and 10-15% of it is converted by N-demethylation to norcodeine by CYP3A4.
Norcodeine has about the same affinity for the mu opioid receptor as codeine which is 200 times less than that of morphine.
Norcodeine has very little opioid activity.
Actin is the major antigen to which smooth muscle antibodies react in autoimmune hepatitis.
F-Actin IgG antibodies are found in 52-85% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or chronic active hepatitis and in 22% of patients with primary bilary cirrhosis (PBC).

Lorcainide is a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent.
A fungus (plural fungi) is a eukaryotic organism that digests its food externally and absorbs the nutrient molecules into its cells.
Along with bacteria, fungi are the primary decomposers of dead organic matter in most terrestrial ecosystems.
Fungi have important symbiotic relationships with many other organisms.
Over 90% of all plants engage in some kind of mycorrhizal relationship with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.
Fungi are also used extensively by humans: yeasts are responsible for fermentation of beer and bread, and mushroom farming and gathering is a large industry in many countries.
The branch of biology involving the study of fungi is known as mycology.

Sialophorin (leukosialin, CD43), also known as SPN, is a human gene.
Sialophorin (leukosialin) is a major sialoglycoprotein on the surface of human T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes, which appears to be important for immune function and may be part of a physiologic ligand-receptor complex involved in T-cell activation.
The enzyme citrate synthase (E.C. 2.3.3.1) exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the Citric Acid Cycle (or Krebs Cycle).
Citrate synthase is localized within eukaryotic cells in the mitochondrial matrix, but is encoded by nuclear DNA rather than mitochondrial.
It is synthesized using cytoplasmic ribosomes, then transported into the mitochondrial matrix.
Citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact mitochondria.
CD3 is a marker found on all functional T cells, while CD5 is a cluster of differentiation antigen found on most T cells and a subset of IgM secreting B cells.
In normal subjects, most CD3+ T cells also express CD5.
About 76 % of T cell neoplasms express Cd5, although it is not present in cutaneous T cell lymphoma.
The absence of CD5 in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with poor prognosis
The risks associated with the misinterpretation of passive and immune anti-D are clear: if passive anti-D is misinterpreted as immune, anti-D prophylaxis may be omitted leaving the women unprotected from sensitisation.
If immune anti-D is misinterpreted as passive, appropriate follow-up of the antibody level during pregnancy may be curtailed putting the fetus at risk.
The CASR gene (calcium-sensing receptor) is located on chromosome 3q13.
The protein encoded by this gene is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-producing chief cells of the parathyroid gland, and the cells lining the kidney tubule.
It senses small changes in circulating calcium concentration and couples this information to intracellular signaling pathways that modify PTH secretion or renal cation handling, thus this protein plays an essential role in maintaining mineral ion homeostasis.
Mutations in this gene cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, familial, isolated hypoparathyroidism, and neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism.
The total liquid volume of gas delivered by a single gas delivery system, potentially across multiple cases.
A plasma protein which is the precursor of kallikrein.
Plasma that is deficient in prekallikrein has been found to be abnormal in thromboplastin formation, kinin generation, evolution of a permeability globulin, and plasmin formation.
The absence of prekallikrein in plasma leads to Fletcher factor deficiency, a congenital disease.
Nickel can be elevated in industrial exposures (specifically steels, some inks and batteries) and infarctions to target organs like heart, brain, or from massive skin damage.
Nickel can cause skin rash - usually from nickel in jewelry.
Chronic inhalation can also cause nasal and lung cancer.
In animal feed, the toxic dietary concentration is 10-100 times greater than normal feed concentrations.
Symptoms of nickel toxicity (observed under experimental conditions) include depressed growth, feed intake and feed efficiency, hematological changes, and possible kidney damage.(Mineral Tolerance of Animals: Second Revised Edition, 2005)
Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CD274 gene.
PD-L1 is the major ligand for the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor, which is present on the surface of T, B and NK cells and is part of the B7-CD28 superfamily.
Binding PD-L1 and PD-L2 to the PD-1 receptor found on T-cells inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production.
An increase PD-L1 expression occurs in some tumors, which helps protect them against active T-cell immune surveillance by binding to PD-1 and inhibiting the T-cell response.
Positive PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in tumor cells may predict tumor response to therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are a new class of drugs that trigger an immune response against cancer cells by effectively suppressing the tumor's ability to inhibit the immune response.
Drugs in this class include pembrolizumab and nivolumab, both of which are anti-PD-1 receptor antibodies, and atezolizumab, which is an anti-PD-L1 antibody.
PD-L1 may be a prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic marker in a variety of neoplasms, including carcinomas of the bladder, lung, and kidney.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the development of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant.
In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4).
These antibodies are usually of the IgG class, which form a complex with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream.
The tail of the antibody then binds to the FcÎ³IIa receptor, a protein on the surface of the platelet.
This results in platelet activation and the formation of platelet microparticles, which initiate the formation of blood clots; the platelet count falls as a result, leading to thrombocytopenia.

It is native to most of North America including all of southern Canada, nearly all of the continental United States, and the northern half of Mexico.
It is a common plant in many habitat types, including disturbed areas such as roadsides.
It can be found in parts of Eurasia as an introduced species.
This is an erect perennial herb growing a slender, branching, straw-colored stem to a maximum height near two meters, but more often remaining under one meter tall.
Leaves are up to 12 centimeters long and vary in shape from lance-shaped to nearly oval, and they are divided into many narrow, pointed lobes.
The stem and leaves are hairy.
The top of the stem is occupied by an inflorescence which is usually a spike.
The species is monoecious, and the inflorescence is composed of staminate (male) flower heads with the pistillate heads located below and in the axils of leaves.
The pistillate heads yield fruits which are achenes located within oval-shaped greenish-brown burs about half a centimeter long.
The burs are hairy and sometimes spiny.
The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting up from a creeping rhizome-like root system.
This plant had a number of medicinal uses among several different Native American groups.

It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate.
Movement abnormalities, akathisia, Parkinsonism, dystonia, as well as agitation, anxiety, somnolence, nausea and drowsiness are the most frequent adverse effects.
As of September 2019, lurasidone has a black box warning for "increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Cefixime is an oral third generation cephalosporin antibiotic.
It was sold under the trade name Suprax in the USA, until 2003 when it was taken off the market by drug manufacturer Wyeth after its patent expired.
Cefixime is still available in Canada.
It is used to treat gonorrhea.
Transmembrane pressure (TMP) is the pressure difference across the dialysis membrane.
An increasing TMP in conjunction with decreasing effluent pressure is an indicator of membrane clogging due to protein build-up on the blood side of the filter.
An antidepressant is a medication designed to treat or alleviate the symptoms of clinical depression.
Some antidepressants, notably the tricyclics, are commonly used off-label in the treatment of neuropathic pain, whether or not the patient is depressed.
Smaller doses are generally used for this purpose, and they often take effect more quickly.
Many antidepressants also are used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, and tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of chronic pain disorders such as chronic functional abdominal pain (CFAP), myofascial pain syndrome, and post-herpetic neuralgia.
The main classes of antidepressants have similar efficacy, but the newer types are generally regarded to have a more benign side-effect profile and less risk of lethality if taken in overdose.
The endoglin gene (ENG) and the activin A receptor, type II-like 1 gene (ACVRL1) are most commonly associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).
Mutations in these genes occur in about 80% of individuals with HHT.
ENG and ACVRL1 encode for membrane glycoproteins involved in transforming growth factor-beta signaling related to vascular integrity.
Mutations in ENG are associated with HHT type 1 (HHT1), a condition with a higher incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, whereas ACVRL1 mutations occur in HHT type 2 (HHT2), a condition with a higher incidence of hepatic arteriovenous malformations.
The majority of mutations in ENG and ACVRL1 are point mutations, which are identified by sequencing with a detection rate of approximately 60% to 80% of mutations involved in HHT.
Approximately 10% of ENG and ACVRL1 mutations are large genomic deletions and duplications, which are detectable by methods such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).
he joining of a V and a J gene segment creates a continuous exon that encodes the whole of the light-chain V region.
In the unrearranged DNA, the V gene segments are located relatively far away from the C region.
The J gene segments are located close to the C region, however, and joining of a V segment to a J gene segment also brings the V gene close to a C-region sequence.
The J gene segment of the rearranged V region is separated from a C-region sequence only by an intron.
In the experiment shown in Fig.
4.1, the germline DNA fragment identified by the 'V-region probe' contains the V gene segment, and that identified by the 'C-region probe' actually contains both the J gene segment and the C-region sequence.
To make a complete immunoglobulin light-chain messenger RNA, the V-region exon is joined to the C-region sequence by RNA splicing after transcription
Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is an acute, contagious viral disease of swine caused by the swine vesicular disease virus, an enterovirus.
It is characterized by fever and vesicles with subsequent ulcers in the mouth and on the snout, feet, and teats.

These are the most common ailments attributable to Cockroach infestation of housing and are important public health problems.
Cockroach allergens (like Mite allergens) have an association with socioeconomic factors and population density
Non-essential amino acids (NEAA) are amino acids that can be synthesized by the body to meet requirements for maintenance, growth, development, and health.
Although NEAA are not a necessary part of the diet, both plant and animal-based proteins are rich sources.
Examples of NEAAs include: arginine, glutamine, and tyrosine.
NEAAs play important roles in regulating gene expression, cell signaling pathways, digestion and absorption of dietary nutrients, DNA and protein synthesis, proteolysis, metabolism of glucose and lipids, endocrine status, fertility, acid-base balance, anti-oxidative responses, detoxification of xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites, neurotransmission, and immunity.
Cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB) is a protein that is produced by gram negative bacteria.
CdtB targets eukaryotic DNA.
Antibodies against this toxin can cross react with vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein found in epithelial cells.
In animal models, these vinculin antibodies have been shown to cause symtoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
CdtB antibodies are useful as biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (D-IBS) in humans, and may help distinguish D-IBS from inflammatory bowel disease in the workup of chronic diarrhea.
Integrin, alpha E (ITGAE) also known as CD103 (Cluster of Differentiation 103) is an integrin.
CD103 is expressed on a subset of T cells, termed regulatory T cells (Tregs).
Tregs are important for decreasing the immune response and appear to play a crucial role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases.
Tregs are defined as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells.
Some CD4+FoxP3- cells also express CD103 and have been attributed regulatory activity.
The MXI1 gene (MAX interactor 1, dimerization protein) is located on chromosome 10q24-q25.
Expression of the c-myc gene, which produces an oncogenic transcription factor, is tightly regulated in normal cells but is frequently deregulated in human cancers.
The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor thought to negatively regulate MYC function, and is therefore a potential tumor suppressor.
This protein inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by competing for MAX, another basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to MYC and is required for its function.
Defects in this gene are frequently found in patients with prostate tumors.
Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.
Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist but the products of these transcripts have not been verified experimentally.

The mechanisms of its effects in movement disorders are not well understood but probably reflect an increase in synthesis and release of dopamine, with perhaps some inhibition of dopamine uptake.
5' Nucleotidase testing provides supportive evidence in the diagnosis of liver disease.
5'-nucleotidase is elevated in liver disease, hepatic carcinoma, biliary cirrhosis, extra-hepatic obstruction and metaplastic metaplasia of the liver and usually is not elevated in skleletal disease.
Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a high-molecular-weight plasma protein produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.
It is part of the factor VIII/vWF complex.
The vWF has receptors for collagen, platelets, and ristocetin.
Ristocetin is an antibiotic, previously used to treat staphylococcal infections, now mainly used in vitro to diagnose conditions such as von Willebrand disease.
Platelet agglutination caused by ristocetin can occur only in the presence of von Willebrand factor multimers, so if ristocetin is added to blood lacking the factor it will not coagulate.
The vWF facilitates the adhesion of platelets to collagen and hemostatic plug formation.
The prolonged bleeding time in von Willebrand's disease is due to the deficiency of this factor.
Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an inherited disorder characterized by inadequate levels of an enzyme that helps break down the amino acid leucine.
In severe cases, signs and symptoms become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, lethargy, coma, and possibly death.
In other cases, signs and symptoms appear during childhood.
Isovaleric acidemia is caused by mutations in the IVD gene and has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
Candida dubliniensis is an opportunistic fungal pathogen first isolated in 1995 from the oral cavity of HIV patients, and it is a more common cause of disease in patients with hematologic malignancies.
Although it is a close relative of the major pathogenic species, Candida albicans, and rates of invasive disease caused by C. dubliniensis are possibly increasing, it has proven to be less virulent.
Its phenotypic similarities have sometimes resulted in misidentification as C. albicans.
Isolates have mostly been found to be sensitive to itraconazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin B, and fluconazole, although fluconazole-resistant cases have emerged .
2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, also known as isooctane or iso-octane, is an octane isomer which defines the 100 point on the octane rating scale (the zero point is n-heptane).
It is an important component of gasoline.
This compound is hazardous to the human body.
When 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is inhaled it can cause confusion, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and severe vomiting.

They can be identified by their distinctive combination of black-and-yellow color, small size (slightly larger than a bee), and entirely black antennae.
Fonofos is a light yellow liquid with a sulfurous odor.
It is an organothiophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitor used as an insecticide mainly on corn but also on sugar cane, peanuts, tobacco, turf, and some vegetable crops.
Fonofos is effective in combating aphids, corn borer, corn rootworm, corn wireworm, cutworms, white grubs and some maggots.
It is extremely toxic to aquatic wildlife, bees, birds, freshwater fish and saltwater organisms.
There is no evidence that fonofos bioaccumulates in either the environment or in animal tissue.

Other health effects to people who swallow antimony are not known.
Whether antimony can cause cancer or birth defects, or affect reproduction in humans is not known.
Antimony has been used as a medicine to treat people infected with parasites (leishmaniasis).
Patients who have had too much of this medicine, or are sensitive to it, experienced adverse health effects including diarrhea, joint and/or muscle pain, vomiting, problems with the blood (anemia) and heart problems (altered electrocardiograms).
Left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling parameters are based on analysis of LV volume over time as measures of LV diastolic function.
The peak filling rate (PFR) is the maximum change in LV volume over time (dV/dt) during diastole.
The one-third mean filling rate (1/3 MFR) is the average filling rate over the first third of diastole.
The time to PFR (TPFR) is the duration of time from the end of systole to the time where the PFR occurs.
The ratio of TPFR to R-R interval is the ratio of the time to peak filling to the total time of one cardiac cycle.
In one study, patients with the connective tissue disorder systemic sclerosis were found to have significantly higher TPFR and TPFR/R-R interval values compared to controls.
Another study of patients with hypertension found that 1/3 MFR measured after stress was significantly lower in patients with hypertension compared to controls, as was the stress PFR.
Cholestanol (C27H47OH) is formed from the reduction of cholesterol and a marker used to evaluate cholesterol absorption and synthesis disorders, including Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome (SLOS) and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).
Patients with CTX have elevated cholestanol levels (3-15 times higher, ranging from 1.3-15 mg/d) and low-to-normal cholesterol levels (usually 115-220 mg/dL).
For CTX, the cholesterol-to-cholestanol ratio is said to be a better indicator of disease than cholestanol concentration alone.

The IVD gene (isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase) is located on chromosome 15q14-q15.
Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the third step in leucine catabolism.
The genetic deficiency of IVD results in an accumulation of isovaleric acid, which is toxic to the central nervous system and leads to isovaleric acidemia.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
The CYP2B6 gene (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6) is located on chromosome 19q13.2.
This gene, CYP2B6, encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes.
The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids.
This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by phenobarbital.
The enzyme is known to metabolize some xenobiotics, such as the anti-cancer drugs cyclophosphamide and ifosphamide.
Transcript variants for this gene have been described; however, it has not been resolved whether these transcripts are in fact produced by this gene or by a closely related pseudogene, CYP2B7.
Both the gene and the pseudogene are located in the middle of a CYP2A pseudogene found in a large cluster of cytochrome P450 genes from the CYP2A, CYP2B and CYP2F subfamilies on chromosome 19q.
Euphorbia is a very large and diverse genus of flowering plants, commonly called spurge, in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae).
Zygomycota, or zygote fungi, is a phylum of fungi.
The name comes from zygosporangia, where resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction.

The admission priority indicates the general level of acuity of the patient and how quickly clinical intervention or resuscitation is necessary, from newborn to elective to emergent.
The priority and diagnosis or reason for admission have some overlap but are not the same.
For example, one patient with leukemia might be admitted emergently for sepsis, while another patient with the same diagnosis might have a scheduled admission for chemotherapy.
A semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic resistant to beta-lactamase.
Glucose (C6H12O6) is a simple monosaccharide and monomer of carbohydrates.
Glucose provides energy for cellular processes and aids metabolism within the body.
When food is ingested, the carbohydrates within the food are broken down into glucose molecules.
Blood glucose content is significant in determining an individual's overall state of health.
An elevated blood glucose level is called hyperglycemia and a deficient blood glucose level is called hypoglycemia.
When an individual is hyperglycemic and cannot properly regulate their blood glucose level they are considered diabetic.
Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system attacking pancreatic beta cells (cells that produce insulin) and Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance.
Daratumumab is a biologic drug used to treat multiple myeloma.
It is a IgG1k human monoclonal antibody directed against CD38, a molecule present on myeloma cells.
By binding to CD38, it inhibits the growth of CD38 expressing tumor cells and causes cell death by immune mediated tumor cell lysis .
The APOB gene (apolipoprotein B) is located on chromosome 2p24-p23.
This gene product is the main apolipoprotein of chylomicrons and low density lipoproteins.
It occurs in plasma as two main isoforms, apoB-48 and apoB-100: the former is synthesized exclusively in the gut and the latter in the liver.
The intestinal and the hepatic forms of apoB are encoded by a single gene from a single, very long mRNA.
The two isoforms share a common N-terminal sequence.
The shorter apoB-48 protein is produced after RNA editing of the apoB-100 transcript at residue 2180 (CAA->UAA), resulting in the creation of a stop codon, and early translation termination.
Mutations in this gene or its regulatory region cause hypobetalipoproteinemia, normotriglyceridemic hypobetalipoproteinemia, and hypercholesterolemia due to ligand-defective apoB, diseases affecting plasma cholesterol and apoB levels.

It is most frequently observed in southeast Asian populations.
Drugs that mimic the effects of stimulating postganglionic adrenergic sympathetic nerves.
Included here are drugs that directly stimulate adrenergic receptors and drugs that act indirectly by provoking the release of adrenergic transmitters.
A food, which may result in allergy symptoms in sensitised individuals.
Lovage probably originated in Central Asia.
It is a hardy herbaceous perennial herb belonging to the Apiaceae family, along with Carrot, Celery, Caraway, Coriander, Dill, Parsley, etc.
Lovage is an especially close relative of Celery, but is 4 times the size.
The herb has been cultivated since the time of Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), when it was a herbal remedy for sore throat as well as an aphrodisiac.
Lovage was one of the most common flavours in Roman cooking.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that lovage may induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals; however, no studies have been reported to date; it is possible that allergy to lovage, which is closely related to the significantly allergenic carrot and celery, occurs more frequently than has been reported.
The RR interval standard deviation and coefficient of variability both reflect the variation in the time interval between heart beats over a period of time.
Some degree of variability is normal and is due to physiologic processes such as respiration and blood pressure regulation.
Decreased variability of the RR interval is associated with exercise and stress, as well as congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes.
Decreased variability may also be an indicator of increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and also an independent risk factor for mortality after myocardial infarction and in patients with advanced CHF.
Medications can also affect heart rate variability, which effect is an important consideration when making decisions about which medications to use, especially in high-risk patients.
Spermatozoa penetration testing determines sperm's ability to penetrate cervical mucus.

Lyme disease is a multisystem, multistage infection caused by three species of tick-borne spirochetes in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genogroup.
These spirochetes include B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (North America and Western Europe), B. afzelii (Central and Western Europe and Russia), and B. garinii (Europe, Russia, and northern Asia).
Endemic areas for Lyme disease in the United States correspond with the distribution of two tick species, Ixodes dammini (Northeastern and Upper Midwestern US) and Ixodes pacificus (West Coast US).
In Europe, Ixodes ricinus transmits the spirochete.
Human Lyme borreliosis, the most prevalent arthropod-borne infection in temperate climate zones around the world, is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the skin lesion erythema migrans and the potential development of neurologic, cardiac, and joint abnormalities.
B. garinii, the most neurotropic of these three genospecies, causes most neurologic Lyme disease in Europe, including cases of meningopolyneuritis and, rarely, encephalomyelitis.
Although probably all three genospecies can cause all major manifestations, it appears that infection with different B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies results in distinct presentations of Lyme borreliosis.
In Europe, B. afzelii is mostly associated with skin manifestations, such as erythema migrans, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, whereas B. garinii is the main cause of Lyme neuroborreliosis.
Patients with B. garinii isolated from CSF samples have a distinct clinical presentation, compared with that of patients with B. afzelii infection.
Cycloguanil is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, and is a metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of proguanil.
However, more recent work has indicated that, while proguanil is synergistic with the drug atovaquone (as in the combination Malarone), cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic to the effects of atovaquone, suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, proguanil may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.
Although cycloguanil is not currently in general use as an antimalarial, the continuing development of resistance to current antimalarial drugs has led to renewed interest in studying the use of cycloguanil in combination with other drugs
A genus of trematodes, Schistosoma, (also called blood-flukes or parasitic flatworms) is responsible for a very significant group of infections in humans termed schistosomiasis.
Schistosomiasis is considered by the World Health Organization as the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease, (after malaria), with hundreds of millions infected worldwide.
The three main species infecting humans are Schistosoma haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni.
Two other species, more localized geographically, are S. mekongi and S. intercalatum.
Other species of schistosomes which parasitize birds and mammals can cause cercarial dermatitis in humans.
Myeloperoxidase is a neutrophilic enzyme that produces oxidants such as free radicals and hypohalous acids.
This enzyme is released into phagosomes in order to destroy phagocytized pathogens.
Although the oxidants produced by myeloperoxidase aid in immunity defense, these oxidants can also lead to damage of the host tissue and increased oxidative stress (often associated with inflammation).
Elevated levels of myeloperoxidase have been observed in individuals with the following conditions: heart disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease.

Treponema pallidum is a gram-negative spirochaete bacterium thought to be metabolically crippled.
There are at least four known subspecies: T. pallidum pallidum, which causes syphilis, T. pallidum pertenue, which causes yaws, T. pallidum carateum, which causes pinta and T. pallidum endemicum, which causes bejel.
T. pallidum pallidum is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium.
The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis.
The helical structure of T. pallidum pallidum allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through viscous mediums such as mucus.
It gains access to host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucus membranes.
Cardiac valve area can be measured (orifice area) or indirectly calculated (effective orifice area).
Direct measurement can be done on echo, and calculations are based on other measurements such as blood flow volume and velocity.
The effective orifice area is calculated based on the equation F=AÃV, where F is flow, A is area and V is velocity.
The velocity is measured directly with Doppler echo and indirectly during cardiac catheterization based on the Torricelli law from the transvalvular pressure gradient: V=â2gh, where g is the velocity of acceleration resulting from gravity and h is the pressure gradient.
Therefore, for area as measured by cardiac catheterization, the formula is A=F/â2gh.
Cervical mucus, a heterogenous secretion, contains approximately 90% water.
Cervical mucus properties allow for: respective environment for sperm, protection of spermatozoa from hostile environment of the vagina and being phagocytized, supplemental energy requirements for sperm, differential selection of sperm based on motility and morphology, and initiation of sperm capacitation.
Spermatozoa's ability to penetrate cervical mucus in the female reproductive tract is critical to function and survivability.
Ideal testing involves using the partner's cervical mucus rather than synthetic gels, such as bovine cervical mucus.
Abnormal cervical mucus penetration findings can be an indication of infertility.
Remarks, interpretations, or impressions added to manual differential results by a laboratorian or pathologist.
Norolanzapine (also known as desmethylolanzapine) is one of the metabolites of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Isomaltase is an enzyme that breaks the bonds linking saccharides, which cannot be broken by amylase or maltase.
It digests polysaccharides at the alpha 1-6 linkages.
Its substrate, alpha-limit dextrin, is a product of amylose digestion that retains its 1-6 linkage (its alpha 1-4 linkages having already been broken down by amylase).
The product of the enzymatic digestion of alpha-limit dextrin by isomaltase is maltose.
It helps amylase to digest a-limit dextrin to produce maltose.

In the liver, Vitamin D is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of vitamin D, and then to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in turn binds to the intracellular vitamin D receptor.
The Nutmeg tree is a large evergreen native to the Spice Islands but now also cultivated in the Caribbean and Mauritius.
The tree produces 2 spices, Mace and Nutmeg.
Nutmeg is the oval, 25 mm brown seed kernel inside the fruit pit, and Mace is the bright red or purple lacy covering on the pit.
Nutmeg is dried and sold whole or ground, and Mace is dried and powdered.
Both Mace and Nutmeg spice are strongly aromatic, Mace somewhat more so.
Its higher price is principally due to the yield of Mace being much smaller.
It is not certain whether Nutmeg and Mace became known in Europe only in the 11th century AD or were known to the Romans.
Nutmeg may uncommonly induce symptoms of food allergy or contact dermatitis in sensitised individuals.
Few studies, however, have investigated or reported adverse reactions to spices, including Nutmeg.

It inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation by inhibiting the response to interleukin 2 (IL-2).
Its mode of action differs from that of other immunosuppressants (SN Sehga, Clin Biochem, 31:335, 1998) most notably by not being a calcineurin inhibitor.
Its inhibitory action is mediated via a cytosolic protein, FK-binding protein 12.
Sirolimus is variably absorbed; levels need to monitored to achieve the therapeutic target while avoiding toxic levels.
Sirolimus is marketed under the trade name Rapamune.
The mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr-1 to mcr-5, and variants) are located on a plasmid within bacterial cells and affect the ability of antibiotics, including polymyxins and colistin, to bind to the bacteria.
The mode of action of the antibiotics is to bind to the outer membrane of the phosphate group of lipid A lipopolysaccharide and to intercalate into the inner membrane forming pores that result in bacterial lysis.
The polymyxins & colistin are the last line of defense used to treat multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria so the emergence of the mcr genes in Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, is onerous and challenging to public health.

The risk can be estimated based on maternal age and prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.Trisomy 18, also called Edwards syndrome, is caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome 18 in each cell rather than two.
Edwards syndrome is associated with intrauterine growth retardation and fetal demise, and liveborn infants with Edwards syndrome typically have low birth weight, congenital heart disease, and characteristic physical features.
Less than 10% of liveborn infants with Edwards syndrome live past their first year.
The general population risk of Edwards syndrome is 1 out of 5,000 live births, and the risk for Edwards syndrome increases with increasing maternal age.
Erucic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid found mainly in the Brassica family of plants such as canola, rapeseed, wallflower seed, mustard seed as well as Brussels spouts and broccoli.
Some Brassica cultivars can have up to 40 to 50 percent of their oil recovered as erucic acid.
Erucic acid is also known as cis-13-docosenoic acid.
The trans isomer is known as brassidic acid.
Erucic acid occurs in nature only along with bitter-tasting compounds.
Erucic acid has many of the same uses as mineral oils but with the advantage that it is more readily bio-degradable.
Its high tolerance to temperature makes it suitable for transmission oil.
Its ability to polymerize and dry means it can be - and is - used as a binder for oil paints.
Increased levels of eicosenoic acid (20:ln9) and erucic acid (22:1n9) have been found in the red blood cell membranes of autistic subjects with developmental regression.
Erucic acid is broken down long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is produced in the liver.
This enzyme breaks this long chain fatty acid into shorter-chain fatty acids.
Human infants have relatively low amounts of this enzyme and because of this, babies should not be given foods high in erucic acid.

It is never used on its own to treat tuberculosis; it is used in a similar way to ethambutol.
Thioacetazone is the only anti-TB drug that is ineffective when given intermittently.
There is no advantage to using thioacetazone if the regimen used already contains ethambutol, but many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still use thioacetazone because it is extremely cheap.
Use of thioacetazone is declining because it can cause severe (sometimes fatal) skin reactions in HIV positive patients

Norepinephrine (INN) or noradrenaline (BAN) is a catecholamine and a phenethylamine with chemical formula C 8 H 11 N O 3.
The natural stereoisomer is L-(Ë')-(R)-norepinephrine.
It is released from the medulla of the adrenal glands as a hormone into the blood, but it is also a neurotransmitter in the nervous system where it is released from noradrenergic neurons during synaptic transmission.
As a stress hormone, it affects parts of the human brain where attention and impulsivity are controlled.
Along with epinephrine, this compound affects the fight-or-flight response, activating the sympathetic nervous system to directly increase heart rate, release energy from fat, and increase muscle readiness.
Norepinephrine is released when a host of physiological changes activated by a stressful event, unleashed in part by activation of an area of the brain stem called the locus ceruleus.
This nucleus is the origin of most norepinephrine pathways in the brain.
The SMC1A gene (structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A) is located on chromosome Xp11.22-p11.21.
Proper cohesion of sister chromatids is a prerequisite for the correct segregation of chromosomes during cell division.
The cohesin multiprotein complex is required for sister chromatid cohesion.
This complex is composed partly of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins, SMC3 and either SMC1B or the protein encoded by this gene.
Most of the cohesin complexes dissociate from the chromosomes before mitosis, although those complexes at the kinetochore remain.

Maltose binding proteins (MBPs) are soluble carrier proteins that, when bound to recombinant proteins, decrease aggregation and increase solubility of those recombinant proteins.
Fusion protein technology is used in allergy testing for recombinant allergens, such as most of the ImmunoCAP recombinant allergens that otherwise would not stay in solution, which is necessary for testing purposes.
Testing for antibodies to MBP alone (without the recombinant allergen) can serve as a negative control to make sure that antibody response to the MBP-allergen molecule is in response to the allergen part of the molecule, and not the MBP.
For example, if a patient has an IgE response to a particular MBP-allergen fused molecule and does not have a response to MBP alone, the MBP-allergen response is likely due to the allergen itself.
However, if a patient has a response to both the MBP-allergen fused molecule and MBP alone, then the result is inconclusive in regards to the allergen.

The COL5A1 gene (collagen, type V, alpha 1) is located on chromosome 9q34.2-q34.3.
This gene encodes an alpha chain for one of the low abundance fibrillar collagens.
Fibrillar collagen molecules are trimers that can be composed of one or more types of alpha chains.
Type V collagen is found in tissues containing type I collagen and appears to regulate the assembly of heterotypic fibers composed of both type I and type V collagen.
This gene product is closely related to type XI collagen and it is possible that the collagen chains of types V and XI constitute a single collagen type with tissue-specific chain combinations.
The encoded procollagen protein occurs commonly as the heterotrimer pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha1(V)-pro-alpha2(V).
Mutations in this gene are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, types I and II.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants.

Laminin subunit alpha-2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LAMA2 gene.
Laminin, an extracellular protein, is a major component of the basement membrane.
It is thought to mediate the attachment, migration, and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components.
It is composed of three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma, which are bound to each other by disulfide bonds into a cross-shaped molecule.
This gene encodes the alpha 2 chain, which constitutes one of the subunits of laminin 2 (merosin) and laminin 4 (s-merosin).
Mutations in this gene have been identified as the cause of congenital merosin-deficient muscular dystrophy.
Two transcript variants encoding different proteins have been found for this gene.

Cholecalciferol, also known as Vit D3, is a fat-soluble prohormone.
Vitamin D has many functions including the regulation of calcium and phosphorus levels in blood, the promotion of bone formation and mineralization, and aid to the immune system by supporting phagocyctosis, anti-tumor activity, and immunomodulatory functions.
A deficiency of vitamin D can be due to many causes including inadequate dietary intake, insufficient sunlight, malabsorption problems, inability to convert vitamin D into its active metabolite, kidney or liver impairment and many others.
Vitamin D occurs naturally only in fish.
It is produced in the skin when UVB radiation from sunlight reacts with 7-dehydrocholesterol (a derivative of cholesterol) to form pre-vitamin D3.
The pre-vitamin D3 isomerizes to Vitamin D and is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.
25-hydroxycholecalciferol is in turn hydroxylated in the kidney into two dihydroxylated metabolites which are 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the active hormone) and 24R,25 (OH)2D3.

11-oxygenated C19 (11oxC19) steroids are produced in the adrenal gland.
11oxC19s include 11-Hydroxytestosterone (11-OHT) and 11-Ketotestosterone (11-KT).
11-OHT is formed from testosterone, and 11-KT is formed from 11-OHT. 11-KT is a potent androgen and binds to the human androgen receptor AR.
Various 11oxC19 steroids, including 11-OHT and 11-KT, are emerging as potentially useful biomarkers in patients with endocrine disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, polycystic ovary syndrome, androgen-dependent and androgen-producing tumors, and premature adrenarche.
Specifically, higher than normal levels of 11oxC19 steroids have been found in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency and in polycystic ovary syndrome.
The 11oxC19 steroids are also thought to increase progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer, and might have clinical implications in adrenarche and postmenopausal women.

Lymphoma markers look for particular molecules of a very specific type that are located on the surface of the cells.
On the surface of the cells that carry the lymphoma, these cells are called lymphocytes, the molecules residing there are called CD markers (Cluster Differentiation).
We have so far managed to identify a little under one hundred of these different types of cells and what makes them so useful is that when a normal lymphocyte change over time from newly built cells into mature cells, the markers also change.
Cells that used to look the same when inspected under a microscope now was found to carry different CD markers leading to completely different behavior.

Western equine encephalitis (WEE) is a relatively uncommon viral infection caused by the WEE virus, an Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae.
WEE virus is an (arthropod-borne virus) transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Culex and Culiseta.
There have been under 700 confirmed cases in the U.S. since 1964.
In the U.S. WEE is seen mainly in states west of the Mississippi River.
The disease is also seen in countries of South America.
WEE is commonly a subclinical infection; symptomatic infections are uncommon.
However, the disease can cause serious sequellae in infants and children.
Unlike Eastern equine encephalitis, the overall mortality of WEE is low (approximately 4%) and is associated mostly with infection in the elderly.
There is no vaccine for WEE and there are no licensed therapeutic drugs in the U.S. for this infection.

This gene encodes a protein that plays a major role in the bidirectional stimulation of T and B cells.
This protein contains an SH2 domain and a short tail.
It associates with the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule, thereby acting as an inhibitor of this transmembrane protein by blocking the recruitment of the SH2-domain-containing signal-transduction molecule SHP-2 to its docking site.
This protein can also bind to other related surface molecules that are expressed on activated T, B and NK cells, thereby modifying signal transduction pathways in these cells.
Mutations in this gene cause lymphoproliferative syndrome X-linked type 1 or Duncan disease, a rare immunodeficiency characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection with Epstein-Barr virus, with symptoms including severe mononucleosis and malignant lymphoma.

It is best known as the traditional, primary ingredient of mothballs.
It is volatile, forming a flammable vapor, and readily sublimes at room temperature, producing a characteristic odor that is detectable at concentrations as low as 0.08 ppm by mass.
Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells.
Humans, particularly children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.
Symptoms include fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin.
Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the urine, and jaundice (yellow coloration of the skin).
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a double-stranded alphaherpesvirus that causes seasonal outbreaks of chickenpox and shingles in non-immunized populations.
VZV is highly infectious and is transmitted by contact with the ruptured fluid filled blisters and respiratory secretions of infected individuals.
Immunity post infection is usually lifelong though the latent virus inhabits the sensory nerve ganglia where it can reactivate causing shingles when immunity declines with aging.
In the over fifty strains of VZV that have been sequenced it has been found that a single nucleotide polymorphism occurs about every 100 bases.
The patterns of polymorphisms in VZV correlate with different geographical regions of infection and is the basis for the classification of viral clades.
Breuer proposed the nomenclature for the VZV clades as 1-5 with the suspected clades VI and VII to be confirmed later.
Aureobasidium pullulans is a fungus that appears in the surface layers of soils and has also been reported on wheat seeds, barley, oats, tomato and pecans.
Aureobasidium may result in adverse effects via a number of pathophysiological mechanisms including: (a) infection by the organism, (b) generation of a deleterious immune response (e.g. allergy or hypersensitivity pneumonitis), and c) toxic-irritant effects from mould metabolites (e.g. mycelial components, mycotoxins, or volatile organic compounds).

It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon.
Recent concerns with depletion of the ozone layer by freon gases have led to increased use of isobutane as a gas for refrigeration systems, especially in domestic refrigerators and freezers, and as a propellant in aerosol sprays.
When used as a refrigerant or a propellant, isobutane is also known as R-600a.
Some portable camp stoves use a mixture of isobutane with propane, usually 80:20.
Isobutane is used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane.
Isobutane is the R group for the amino acid leucine.
The ATRX gene (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) is located on chromosome Xq21.1.
The protein encoded by this gene contains an ATPase/helicase domain, and thus it belongs to the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling proteins.
This protein is found to undergo cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation, which regulates its nuclear matrix and chromatin association, and suggests its involvement in the gene regulation at interphase and chromosomal segregation in mitosis.
Mutations in this gene are associated with an X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome most often accompanied by alpha-thalassemia (ATRX) syndrome.
These mutations have been shown to cause diverse changes in the pattern of DNA methylation, which may provide a link between chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and gene expression in developmental processes.

Red cedar has been reported to be a significant cause of early spring hayfever, and occasionally asthma, in the southeastern states of the USA.
Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide known as the "hunger hormone" and produced by ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract where it has an important physiological effect on gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility.
Ghrelin acts on hypothalamic brain cells to increase hunger and increase gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility to prepare the body for food intake.
In clinical studies related to energy and glucose metabolism, ghrelin is often measured.
Defective ghrelin signaling from the stomach could contribute to abnormalities in energy balance, growth, and associated gastrointestinal and neuroendocrine functions.

Percent methylation is one of the tests ordered after more conventional Fragile X testing is positive.
This test is performed only on full mutation patients, and is more frequently requested in males.
The value is traditionally reported as a percent, and it represents the fraction of all full mutation bands that are methylated.
Effectively, it represents the proportion of the patient's cells that would not be able to make protein.
Clinically, higher % methylation results in lower levels of protein and, therefore, decreased cognitive ability.
The calculation is done from band intensities on a Southern blot as follows: (methylated full mutation band intensities) / (sum of intensities of the methylated full mutation bands + unmethylated full mutation bands).
Genetic disorders in humans are often a result of unbalanced chromosome abnormalities with net gain or loss of genetic material.
Early technologies for chromosome analysis involved examining the banding patterns to assess chromosome deletion and/or duplication, known as a karyotype.
Karotyping does not reveal microdeletions.
Newer technologies have emerged including microarray, which includes both array comparative genomic hybridization (arrCGH) and SNP-based microarray, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Microarray can detect aneuploidies, deletions, duplications, and amplifications of any locus within the array.
It can identify genetic aberrations that include trisomy 13, trisomy 18 and trisomy 21.
FISH is able to demonstrate duplications, deletions, translocations and amplifications of DNA.
It is able to assess multiple genetic anomalies using different fluorescent dyes and multiple probes.
Among other uses, FISH can detect HER-2/neu to determine if a patient would benefit from treatment with Herceptin and identify BCR-ABL in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia to determine if imatinib would be an effective treatment.

Six other examples were identified in 1964 and 1965.
The antibody was officially reported in 1967 and named after one of the early patients.
Nine years later a similar and related antibody was described, ie. anti-Rodgers.
Initially it was believed that these might be white cell or HLA antibodies.
When the first several antibody producers were HLA typed, it was found that they all had the HLA-A1,B8 phenotype.
In addition, human plasma was able to inhibit both of these antibodies.
Finally, in 1978 the association became clear when it was shown that both Chido (Ch) and Rodgers (Rg) were epitopes carried on the fourth component of complement (C4).
The genes for C4 are closely linked to the HLA genes.
Includes serotypes H and O
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as oncogene 24p3 or lipocalin-2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LCN2 gene.

It is expressed in neutrophils and in low levels in the kidney, prostate, and epithelia of the respiratory and alimentary tracts.
NGAL is used as a biomarker of kidney injury, which occurs about 30 percent of the time in heart failure patients.
The Lime is native to the Indo-Malayan region.
It is now grown in tropical regions almost throughout the world, particularly in Florida.
There are 2 main types of this small, lemon-shaped green citrus fruit: the acidic (the chief kinds being Persian limes and Mexican or Key limes), which is commercially grown, and the sweet, which is uncommon in North America.
Limes have been crossed with other types of citrus.

Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) is a mucin molecule and blood tumor marker used to gauge the response to treatment of invasive breast cancer.
CA 15-3 is encoded by the MUC1 gene and is a transmembrane glycoprotein.
CA 15-3 may contribute to the growth of breast tumors by preventing tumor cell cytolysis by cytotoxic T-cells or lymphokine-activated cells.
It may also block the proliferation of T-cells by causing apoptosis.
In addition, CA 15-3 has been found to be expressed over the entire cell in malignant breast tissue while normal breast tissue expresses CA 15-3 only on the apical side of the glanudular epithelial cells.
The presence of CA 15-3 is not unique to patients with breast cancer, but can also be found in patients with lung, colorectal, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.
Patients with primary tumors tend to have lower levels of CA 15-3, though the average concentration and percentage of patients goes up as the tumor stage or size of the tumor increases.
While only a small number of recurrences of local or regional tumors result in an increased CA 15-3 level, over 70% of patients with remote metastasis have much higher CA 15-3 levels.
Oral glucose inhibits the release of somatotropin, or growth hormone.
In some disorders such as acromegaly, growth hormone increases in response to glucose.
Measuring growth hormone after administration of glucose is used as a screening test for acromegaly and to monitor the response to treatment.
The b-wave is an electroretinographic (ERG) measurement of the corneal-positive deflection, derived from the inner retina (predominantly Muller and ON-bipolar cells).
The hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cells results in a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitter released, which subsequently leads to a depolarization of the post-synaptic bipolar cells.
The bipolar-cell depolarization increases the level of extracellular potassium, subsequently generating a transretinal current.
It is this transretinal current that depolarizes the radially oriented Muller cells and generates the corneal-positive deflection.
The b-wave amplitude is generally measured from the trough of the a-wave to the peak of the b-wave.
This wave is the most common component of the ERG used in clinical and experimental analysis of human retinal function.

Polyunsaturated fat also called (polyunsaturated fatty acid or PUFA) is one of the healthy dietary fats, along with monounsaturated fat.
Found in plant and animal foods, such as salmon, vegetable oils, and some nuts and seeds, eating moderate amounts of polyunsaturated (fat in place of saturated and trans fats can benefit your health.
Polyunsaturated fats can help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol.
Polyunsaturated fats contain omega-3 and omega-6 fats.
These are essential fatty acids that the body needs for brain function and cell growth.

Daclatasvir (also called DCV, formerly called BMS-790052, tradename Daklinza) is a first-generation, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) is a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein that plays a key role in hepatitis C virus RNA replication.
Daclatasvir is used along with other medications, such as sofosbuvir (tradename Solvadi), to treat certain types of chronic hepatitis C. Treatment stops the virus from multiplying and in turn prevents secondary diseases of hepatitis C, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Patients who have no detectable virus in the blood for a longer a period following treatment may be at lower risk of such secondary diseases.
Six different forms of hepatitis C viruses are now known, referred to as genotypes 1 to 6.
In clinical studies, the baseline NS5A polymorphism Y93H resulted in reduced rates of sustained virologic response in patients with HCV genotype 3 who were treated for 12 weeks with daclatasvir (plus sofosbuvir), especially in those patients with cirrhosis.
In addition, the high mutation rate of the HCV genome, combined with selective pressure from ongoing therapy, can lead to selection of additional HCV variants that are resistant to NS5A inhibitors.

Rearrangements or fusions involving ABL-class genes, including ABL1, ABL2 and PDGFRB, are associated with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL), also known as Philadelphia-like (Ph-like) ALL.
Ph-like ALL is characterized as a neoplasm of B lymphoblasts having gene expression similar to BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL cases but lacking the BCR-ABL1 translocation.
Several methods are used to diagnose Ph-like ALL, including gene expression profiling (the "gold standard"), conventional karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and various sequencing techniques.
For positive FISH studies, additional fusion probe or RT-PCR testing is needed to identify translocation partners.
Patients with Ph-like ALL have a poor prognosis but respond well to targeted therapy when the genetic cause is identified.
Treatment options include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy.
The CASR gene encodes a calcium-sensing receptor protein that is expressed in the parathyroid gland and binds extracellular calcium.
If hypercalcemia occurs, the receptor activates the parathyroid G-protein pathway, which results in increased intracellular calcium levels and suppression of PTH gene transcription, and also increases renal calcium excretion.
Inactivating CASR mutations result in various forms of hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, while activating mutations lead to hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia.
Infection with the hepatitis delta virus (hepatitis delta-agent, HDV) is always seen in association with hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, where it may occur as a simultaneous acute infection or as an acute super-infection superimposed upon a case of chronic HBV hepatitis.
This is an RNA virus that requires the presence of HBV for viral replication to occur.
The serologic diagnosis of HDV depends upon the finding of HDV antigen and/or the presence of anti-HDV.
Patients will almost invariably have detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibodies to hepatitis core antigen (anti-HBc) and hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg).
In patients with acute co-infections, hepatitis D antigen (HDVAg) appears early after HBsAg does and disappears with convalescence.
Acute HDV infections are associated with anti-HDV IgM antibody and chronic cases usually only demonstrate IgG antibody.
Both antibodies may eventually disappear following convalescence.
The simultaneous assessment of anti-HBc IgM will help to differentiate co-infections (present) from super-infections (absent).

These molecules are particularly important in biochemistry, where this term refers to alpha-amino acids with the general formula H2NCHRCOOH, where R is an organic substituent.
In the alpha amino acids, the amino and carboxylate groups are attached to the same carbon atom, which is called the Î±-carbon.
The various alpha amino acids differ in which side chain (R group) is attached to their alpha carbon.
They can vary in size from just a hydrogen atom in glycine through a methyl group in alanine to a large heterocyclic group in tryptophan.
The APOB gene encodes apoliprotein B, a primary protein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad" cholesterol), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons.
Apolipoprotein B has 2 forms: the liver produces the B-100 form, which includes a region that is recognized by the ApoB/E LDL receptor, and the small intestine produces B-48, which is cleaved from B-100 and does not include the receptor region.
Mutations in the APOB gene are associated with two disorders: familial ligand-defective apoB-100 hypercholesterolemia (FDB) and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL).
FDB is associated with mutations in the APOB gene that affect the LDL receptor binding region.
The most common mutation known to be associated with FDB is p.Arg3500Gln.
Others include p.Arg3500Trp, p.Arg3531Cys, p.Arg3480Trp, and p.His3543Tyr.
FHBL is associated with mutations in the APOB gene that result in truncated forms of apolipoprotein B.
At least 50 different APOB mutations have been identified that are associated with FHBL.
Fibach E, Flow cytometric analysis of fetal hemoglobin in RBC and their precursors.
Bacillus anthracis lethal factor is one of the three components of the anthrax toxin produced by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax.
This protein acts as a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that, when combined with protective antigen (PA) and entering host cells, disrupts cellular signaling by inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), leading to cell death, particularly in immune cells like macrophages, and contributing to the overall pathogenic effects of anthrax infection.
Shrimp is considered to be a highly allergenic food, causing severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis.
Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron and carries it to the liver, spleen and bone marrow.
Testing for transferrin in stool can determine if bleeding is occurring anywhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Bleeding may be due to early stage carcinoma and adenomatous polyps and can be detected in the stool by measuring intact heme, intact hemoglobin, heme-derived porphyrins and transferrin.
Tests that measure intact hemoglobin are sensitive only to lesions in the lower intestine since hemoglobin is easily broken down and any hemoglobin originating in the upper gastrointestinal tract is unlikely to be intact by the time it reaches the lower intestine.
Transferrin is more stable than hemoglobin and remains intact even when it originates in the upper intestinal tract.

Ofloxacin is a synthetic chemotherapeutic antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class considered to be a second-generation fluoroquinolone.
The original brand, Floxin, has been discontinued by the manufacturer in the United States in 2009, though generic equivalents continue to be available.
Oral and I.V. Floxin is not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of serious reversible and irreversible injury to the musculoskeletal system.
Ofloxacin (and its derivatives) has also been associated with a few isolated reports of unexplained pediatric fatalities.
Children (those under 18) are also at an increased risk of bone, joint, or tendon toxicities.
In the adult population ofloxacin is limited to the treatment of proven serious and life threatening bacterial infections such as: Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis Community-acquired pneumonia Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis Mixed Infections of the urethra and cervix Acute pelvic inflammatory disease Uncomplicated cystitis Complicated urinary tract infections Prostatitis Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea Mycobacterial infections
Jujubes originated in China, where they have been cultivated for more than 4,000 years, and where there are over 400 cultivars.
The spiny trees travelled beyond Asia centuries ago and today are grown to some extent in Russia, northern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and the southwestern United States.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Jujube may induce symptoms of food allergy such as urticaria, angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, dyspnoea, and wheezing in sensitised individuals; however, few studies have been reported to date
Emtricitabine is an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV.
Drug resistance reports assist with treatment decisions.
Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins.
Amino acids and proteins are the building blocks of life.
Amino acids are classified into essential and nonessential.
Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body and they must come from food.
The 9 essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.
Amphetamine (AMPH) is a drug that stimulates both the central and peripheral nervous systems and is used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, narcolepsy and obesity.
AMPH increases extracellular monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain including dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
AMPH promotes presynaptic release of the neurotransmitters rather than blocking their re-uptake.
Physiological responses to AMPH use include increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased body temperature, relaxed bronchial muscle and depressed appetite.
Abuse of AMPH can cause powerful psychological dependence, tolerance, mild physical dependence associated with tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, insomnia, personality changes and an intense form of chronic intoxication psychosis similar to schizophrenia.
Long-term users of AMPH can experience depression, impaired memory and motor skills most likely due to a drop in dopamine transporters and damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.
Excretion of AMPH is in the urine and the rate of elimination is dependent on the pH of the urine.
Urine with an alkaline pH has an excretion rate of 18-34 hours while that of acid urine is 7-14 hours.(Tietz Fundamentals of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Seventh Edition; Carl A. Burtis; David E. Bruns)
Isoxanthopterin is a pteridin present in plasma, urine, and other bodily fluids.
al. (1996) reported increased ratios of pterin to isoxanthopterin in patients with hereditary xanthinuria and molybdenum cofactor deficiency.
Isoxanthopterin and other pterines have been found to be significantly increased in cancer patients.
Pyrazinamide is a drug used to treat tuberculosis in afflicted patients.
The drug is largely bacteriostatic, but can be bacteriocidal on actively replicating tuberculosis bacteria.
Matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) is a member of the gelatinase family, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that can break down any component of the extracellular matrix.
MMP-9 is expressed by leukocytes in severely injured livers and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
MMP-9 plays an important role in the progression of tumors by cleaving heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) and releasing anti-angiogenic fragments.
MMP-9 secreted by HCC cells forecasts an aggressively invasive and metastatic form of cancer.
Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is an obligate pathogenic bacterium in the genus Mycobacterium.
It is often abbreviated M. paratuberculosis or M. avium ssp.
It is the causative agent of Johne's disease, which affects ruminants such as cattle, and also perhaps the human disease Crohn's disease.
Recent studies have shown that MAP present in milk can survive pasteurization, which has raised human health concerns due to the widespread nature of MAP in modern dairy herds.
MAP survival during pasteurization is dependent on the D72C-value of the strains present and their concentration in milk.
It is heat resistant and is capable of sequestering itself inside white blood cells, which may contribute to its persistence in milk.
It has also been reported to survive chlorination in municipal water supplies.
Species of tapeworm in the genus TAENIA, that infects swine.
It is acquired by humans through the ingestion of cured or undercooked pork.
A bicyclic monoterpene ketone found widely in plant (primarily the camphor tree, Cinnamomum camphora).

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) testing is used to evaluate adrenal function and to distinguish androgen secreting conditions that are caused by the adrenal glands from those that originate in the ovaries or testes.
DHEAS testing is performed to diagnose tumors in the cortex of the adrenal gland (adrenocortical tumors), adrenal cancers, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia or adult-onset adrenal hyperplasia and to separate these conditions from ovarian tumors and cancers.
Non-collagenous, calcium-binding glycoprotein of developing bone.
It links collagen to mineral in the bone matrix
The pupil reaction time is the time it takes for the pupil to constrict in response to light.
Factor II DNA analysis: a point mutation (G20210A) in the Factor II (prothrombin) gene is the second most common cause of inherited thrombosis.
The mutation substitutes a guanine with an adenine at nucleotide 20210.
Up to 20% of inherited thrombophilia is due to this mutation.
Incidence is 1-2% among Caucasians and 0.1% in African Americans.
Heterozygous carriers of this mutation have prothrombin levels 30% higher than normal and have an associated 3-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis.
The prothrombin is cleaved to thrombin which acts like a serine protease in the coagulation cascade.
This results in the production of fibrin and promotes clotting activity.
Mutation has also been reported in patients with idiopathic portal vein thrombosis, patients using oral contraceptives, and pregnant patients with placental abruptions and fetal growth restrictions.
Up to 40% of patients with Factor II mutation also carry the Factor V Leiden mutation.
MCAD deficiency is an inherited defect in fatty acid metabolism which can cause a Reyes'-like syndrome in children.
It has been weakly associated with the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Part of newborn screening.
Phenol, also known under an older name of carbolic acid, is a colorless crystalline solid with a typical sweet tarry odor.
Its chemical formula is C 6 H 5 O H and its structure is that of a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a phenyl ring ; it is thus an aromatic compound.
The Zika virus (ZIKV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted by infected cells and is involved in immune evasion and pathogenesis.
While there is some structural similarity between ZIKV NS1 and NS1 from other flaviviruses, antibodies to ZIKV NS1 have been found to be relatively ZIKV-specific.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito which was first identified in a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947.
Since 2014 it has spread explosively in the Americas where it has infected hundreds of thousands of people.
About 80% of those infected are asymptomatic.
Common symptoms include fever, headache, rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis.
Since the end of 2015, there has been an increase in ZIKV-associated cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and a tremendous increase in cases of microcephaly in fetuses and newborns in Brazil, raising worldwide public health concern.
Recent predictions are that the mosquito species A. Albopictus, which can hibernate and survive cool temperatures, will carry ZIKV to more temperate areas of North America, Australia and Southern Europe.
It is still not clear whether ZIKV in humans increases viral titers enough to trigger a new cycle when an infected person is bitten by a naÃ¯ve mosquito.
Direct human-to-human transmission has been documented to occur perinatally, sexually (primarily through semen), through breastfeeding, blood transfusion and through occupational transmission in the laboratory setting.
There are currently no specific anti-viral agents, vaccination or medical prophylaxis available.
ZIKV itself can be detected during the acute phase of infection (4-6 days) using PCR-based methods; alternatively, ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies or a significant titer increase of ZIKV-specific IgG is proof of acute infection.
Antibody titers should be performed using serum samples from the acute and convalescent stages with at least 2 weeks between blood draws.
Ustekinumab (UST) is a human immunoglobulin G1Îº (IgG1Îº) that binds sub-unit p40 of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23).
IL-12 and IL-23 are parts of the Th1 and Th17 inflammatory pathways, respectively, and are important in the development of psoriasis.
Psoriasis has pathogenic similarities to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) which is an inflammatory disorder that is often unresponsive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy.
Also, many patients with PsA who initially respond well to TNF inhibitors eventually stop responding.
UST is not a TNF inhibitor and offers patients with PsA an alternative treatment which has been proven to be effective and safe for short-term use.
The safety for long-term use of UST still needs further study.
Asparagine (abbreviated ASN or N) is one of the 20 most common and yet non-essential amino acid.
It has carboxamide as the side chain 's functional group.
A reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars or reactive carbonyls produces acrylamide (acrylic amide) in food when heated to sufficient temperature.
These occur primarilly in baked goods such as french fries, potato chips, and roasted coffee.
Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant--hence its name--becoming the first amino acid to be isolated.
The smell observed in the urine of some individuals after their consumption of asparagus is attributed to a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of asparagine, asparagine-amino-succinic-acid monoamide.
Gamma aminobutyrate B receptor (GABABR) is a neural surface cell synaptic antigen and is associated with limbic encephalitis and orolingual dyskinesias.
Symptoms of limbic encephalitis include delirium, mood change, memory and personality disturbance and focal seizures of mesial temporal type with or without secondary generalization.
Antibodies against GABABR indicate the possibility of undiscovered small cell lung cancer or other neuroendocrine neoplasia.
Tyrosine is an amino acid commonly found in animal proteins.
It is not essential to the human diet, since it can be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine.
Tyrosine is a precursor of the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as of the thyroid hormones, including thyroxine.
Melanin, the skin and hair pigment, is also derived from this amino acid.
High tyrosine foods include cheese, soybeans, beef, lamb, pork, fish, chicken, nuts, seeds, eggs, dairy, beans, and whole grains.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a disorder in which the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of phenylalanine to tyrosine is not active.
Other defects in tyrosine metabolism include the rare hereditary disorder known as alkaptonuria.
Finely granular cytoplasmic fluorescence, primarily associated with Wegner's granulomatosis.
MDA5, more formally known as interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1, is an immune receptor for viral nucleic acids and plays a major role in activating antiviral responses, including the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines.
Anti-MDA5 autoantibodies, also known as anti-CADM-140, are associated with autoimmune disorders including dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease.
Anti-MDA5 autoantibodies are also found in a subset of patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) who have polyarthritis and ulcerative skin disease but milder muscle disease.
Anti-MDA5 assays may be useful during the work-up of patients with inflammatory disorders and may help guide treatment.
The MYOC gene (myocilin, trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response) is located on chromosome 1q23-q24.
MYOC encodes the protein myocilin, which is believed to have a role in cytoskeletal function.
MYOC is expressed in many occular tissues, including the trabecular meshwork, and was revealed to be the trabecular meshwork glucocorticoid-inducible response protein (TIGR).
The trabecular meshwork is a specialized eye tissue essential in regulating intraocular pressure, and mutations in MYOC have been identified as the cause of hereditary juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma.
Methionine is an essential nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid.
It provides sulfur for other sulfur-containing compounds and is important in the transfer of methyl groups.
Methionine is important in cysteine, carnitine, and taurine synthesis by the transsulfuration pathway, lecithin production, and the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids.(Information from Wikipedia 9/15/06).
Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the compound with the chemical formula PH3.
It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas.
Pure phosphine is odourless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, due to the presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphine (P2H4).
Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative).
Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral phosphine can catalyze reactions to give chiral products.
Basophils are granular white blood cells characterized by a pale-staining nucleus with 2 to 3 lobes and a cytoplasm containing coarse, dark-staining granules of variable size.
They represent 0.5-1% of circulating leukocytes and they are stained by basic dyes.
When activated, they release histamine, leukotrienes and a number of cytokines.
Cannabinol is derived from the Cannabis plant and is a metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
It possesses potential immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties.
Cannabinol preferentially binds to the cannabinoid g-protein coupled receptor CB2 which is located on a number of immune cells including T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
When cannabinol binds to the CB2 receptor it can trigger apoptosis and inhibit the production of some cytokines making it useful as an immunosuppressant or anti-inflammatory drug.
Bordetella holmesii is a Gram-negative bacillus associated with bacteremia, endocarditis, and respiratory illness, mainly in immunocompromised patients.
B. holmesii can be detected by PCR-based methods targeting fumC, a housekeeping gene which encodes the fumarate hydratase class II protein.
S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is formed by the demethylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and is rapidly metabolized to homocysteine.
The reaction of SAH to homocysteine is catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and is reversible with the equilibrium favoring formation of SAH.
Therefore, increased levels of SAH may occur when the intracellular concentration of homocysteine increases.
Since SAH is known to inhibit methylation dependent reactions, the ratio of SAMe to SAH is often used as an index of methylation status.
Disturbances in the transmethylation pathway indicated by abnormal SAMe, SAH or their ratio have been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, depression or Parkinson's disease.

Cocos nucifera is the Latin name.
The coconut is native to tropical eastern regions, but today it is also grown in the tropical parts of the United States, in Central and South America, and in Africa.
The largest producing countries are Mozamibique, Tanzania and Ghana.
It is regarded as a staple food in Asia.
No allergens from this plant have yet been characterised, but some allergens appear to be 55 kDa, 35 kDa and 36.5 kDa in size.
The 35 kDa Coconut protein was shown to be immunologically similar to Soy glycinin (in the legumin group of seed storage proteins).
In 2 patients allergic to Coconut, the clinical reactivity was reported to likely be due to cross-reacting IgE antibodies primarily directed against Walnut, the original clinical allergy reported, and most likely against a Walnut legumin-like protein.
There may be a weak association between Latex allergy and allergy to Coconut.
Protein testing is performed to evaluate and monitor liver and kidney function and to detect and diagnose early kidney damage and various other diseases.
Elevated protein levels may also be due to an infection, medication, vigorous exercise, or emotional or physical stress.
Body fluids contain many different proteins that serve diverse functions such as transport of nutrients, removal of toxins, control of metabolic processes, and defense against invaders.
Testing for protein levels may be done as part of a routine physical, a pregnancy workup, in cased of a suspected UTI, as part of a hospital admission, or to evaluate kidney function.
E-selectin, also known as CD62E, is a cell adhesion molecule expressed only on endothelial cells activated by cytokines.
Like other selectins, it plays an important part in inflammation.
Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is a flowering plant in the genus Sesamum cultivated for its edible seeds.
The exact origin of the species is unknown, although it is thought to have originated in Africa or the Middle East 4,000 years ago.
It is now grown world-wide.
It is an annual plant growing to 50-100 cm tall, with leaves (4-14 cm) on opposite sides; the leaves are broad (5 cm) at the base of the plant, but are progressively narrow to just 1 cm on the flowering stem.
The flowers are white to purple, tubular, 3-5 cm long, with a four-lobed mouth.
The word sesame comes from Latin sesamum.
Sesame is grown primarily for its oil-rich seeds, which come in a variety of colors.
Nicotinuric acid (Nicotinurate) is a metabolite of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (Niacinamide).
The concentration of nicotinuric acid in plasma is largely variable, similar to concentrations of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.
These metabolites are measured as part of therapeutic drug monitoring/toxcicological testing associated with niacin (Vitamin B3) supplementation.
Nicotinuric acid may also serve as a simple quantitative index of hepatic biotransformation of nicotinic acid.
The MMADHC gene (metabolism of cobalamin associated D) is located on chromosome 2q23.2.
This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is involved in an early step of vitamin B12 metabolism.
Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for normal development and survival in humans.
Mutations in this gene cause methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblD (MMADHC), a disorder of cobalamin metabolism that is characterized by decreased levels of the coenzymes adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin.
Pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 11 and X.

Cat-allergic patients with IgE antibodies to Fel d 1 have been shown also to react to the corresponding protein of ocelot, puma, serval, siberian tiger, lion, jaguar, and snow leopard.
A subgroup of cat-allergic patients also react to dogs and sometimes to other animals.
Serum albumin is the main common component.
Extensive cross-reactivity even occurs between albumins of distantly related species and subjects with IgE antibodies to cat albumin may also react to horse, cattle, pig, rodents, and fur animals like mink and fox.
However, great variability exists between patients and selective sensitivity to limited numbers of species occurs, indicating shared and specific epitopes.
Common and species-restricted epitopes have also been observed on the major cat and dog allergens Fel d 1 and Can f 1.
Allergy to cat dander and pork meat, also referred to as the pork/cat syndrome, was shown to be mediated by IgE antibodies recognizing cat and pig serum albumin.
In addition, other kinds of meat may be a risk for patients with this type of sensitivity, as indicated by a case with cat-specific IgE antibodies and exercise-induced anaphylaxis after eating pork or beef.
Latin Name: Morus alba.
Common name is White Mulberry, Silkworm Mulberry.
The Mulberry tree's origin are China, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia.
The tree is now found throughout the world, including the Eastern and Midwestern USA.
The fruit is an aggregate, 1-5 cm long, and is white, becoming pink, and purplish to nearly black.
Fruits may be eaten raw or cooked.

Psilocin (4-hydroxy-dimethyltryptamine, 4-HO-DMT), an aromatic compound, sometimes also (mis)spelled psilocine, psilocyn, or psilotsin, is a psychedelic (hallucinogenic) mushroom alkaloid.
It is found in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin.
Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
The mind altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective.
The effects typically last anywhere from 3 to 8 hours depending on certain variables (such as metabolism, food interaction), however the effects can seem to last much longer due to psilocin's ability to distort the perception of time.
A selective serotonin uptake inhibitor that is used in the treatment of depression.
Adipic acid is a fatty acid metabolite.
Elevated levels occur with fatty oxidation defects including Beta-oxidation defects(MAD,MCAD,SCAD,VLCAD, SCHAD, LCHAD/TFP), HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, systemic carnitine deficiency, succinic semialdehyde DH deficiency, CPT II deficiency, peroxisomal diseases, glycogen storage disorders I & II, lactic acidosis, and fructose intolerance.
Excessive intake of adipic acid-containing foods (such as Jell-O) and foods containing medium chain triglycerides (such as coconut oil) may also cause increased levels.
Isolated high values may be seen in patients with ADD, lethargy, and seizures.

O-desmethyltramadol (M1) is an active metabolite of tramadol which is a narcotic analgesic used to treat severe pain.
Tramadol and M1 work synergistically to relieve pain.
M1 activates the opioid receptor responsible for the analgesic effect of tramadol.
The parent drug prevents reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin which inhibits pain signal transmission in the spinal cord.
M1 metabolism is highly dependent upon CYP2D6 which influences the efficacy of pain relief experienced by the patient.
The predominant adverse side effects associated with tramadol use include nausea, vomiting, sweating, itching, constipation, headache and central nervous system stimulation.
Aldolase is an enzyme which catalyzes the aldol reaction.
It beaks down fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), as part of glycolysis.
In mammalian aldolase the key catalytic amino acid residues involved in the reaction are lysine and tyrosine.
Tyrosine acts as an efficient hydrogen acceptor whereas the lysine covalently binds and stabilized the intermediates.
Many bacteria use two magnesium ions in place of the lysine.
HLA DRB3, 4 and 5 belong to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues that formed as a evolutionary duplication of HLA-DRB1.
The HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB3, and HLA-DRB4 genes encode for the serological antigens DR51, DR52 and DR53, respectively.
While they exhibit fewer polymorphisms than HLA-DRB1, show moderate variability and are only present in a subset of individuals, antibody testing is routinely done as they are thought to play a role in transplant rejection
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP or ThPP), or thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), is a thiamine (vitamin B1) derivative which is produced by the enzyme thiamine pyrophosphatase.
Thiamine pyrophosphate is a coenzyme that is present in all living systems, in which it catalyzes several biochemical reactions.
It was first discovered as an essential nutrient (vitamin) in humans through its link with the peripheral nervous system disease Beriberi, which results from a deficiency of thiamine in the diet.

The RAI1 gene (retinoic acid induced 1) is located on chromosome 17p11.2.
This gene is located within the Smith-Magenis syndrome region on chromosome 17.
It is highly similar to its mouse counterpart and is expressed at high levels mainly in neuronal tissues.
The protein encoded by this gene includes a polymorphic polyglutamine tract in the N-terminal domain.
Expression of the mouse counterpart in neurons is induced by retinoic acid.
This gene is associated with both the severity of the phenotype and the response to medication in schizophrenic patients.
Indole-3-acetic acid, also known as IAA, is a heterocyclic compound that is a phytohormone called auxin.
This colorless solid is probably the most important plant auxin.
The molecule is derived from indole, containing a carboxymethyl group (acetic acid).
Polymorphic DNA markers are used to determine if twins (triples, etc.) are monozygotic (identical) or dizygotic (fraternal).
In some cases, labs may require DNA from the parents to ensure markers are informative and provide the most accurate results.
Genotypes derived from the analysis of the markers are compared between the siblings (and parents).
Any differences indicate dizygosity.
If siblings share the same genotypes, they are considered identical.
Zygosity testing is performed for several reasons, including determining genetic risk for an individual whose sibling is affected with a genetic disorder for which a specific genetic test is uninformative or not available, assessing risks prenatally when one fetus of multiples is known to be affected by a specific disorder, performing organ or bone marrow transplantation compatibility testing, evaluating twin-twin transfusion syndrome during pregnancy, and for general familial or parental interest.
Lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers.
One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(â)-lactic acid or (R)-lactic acid.

The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome 16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5'- zeta - pseudozeta - mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'.
The alpha-2 (HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1) coding sequences are identical.
These genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated regions.
Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA, which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute HbA-2, which with HbF (fetal hemoglobin) makes up the remaining 3% of adult hemoglobin.
Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.

The ELA2 gene (elastase, neutrophil expressed) gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3.
Elastases form a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze many proteins in addition to elastin.
Humans have six elastase genes which encode the structurally similar proteins.
The product of this gene hydrolyzes proteins within specialized neutrophil lysosomes, called azurophil granules, as well as proteins of the extracellular matrix following the protein's release from activated neutrophils.
The enzyme may play a role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases by its proteolysis of collagen-IV and elastin of the extracellular matrix.
This protein degrades the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of E. coli as well as the virulence factors of such bacteria as Shigella, Salmonella and Yersinia.
Mutations in this gene are associated with cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).
This gene is clustered with other serine protease gene family members, azurocidin 1 and proteinase 3 genes, at chromosome 19pter.
All 3 genes are expressed coordinately and their protein products are packaged together into azurophil granules during neutrophil differentiation.

A procollagen peptide contains an additional peptide sequence, termed the propeptide, at its amino and carboxy terminal ends.
Collagen types I, II, III, IV and V are synthesized as precursor molecules called procollagens.
Propeptides facilitate the winding of procollagen molecules into a triple-helix conformation within the endoplasmic reticulum.
These propeptides are then cleaved from the collagen triple helix molecule during its secretion, after which the collagens polymerize into extracellular collagen fibrils.
Thus, the amount of free propeptides directly correlates with collagen molecule synthesis.
Procollagen Type I C-peptide (PIP) has also been extensively referenced in correlation studies between collagen levels and certain health disorders such as bone disease, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and cirrhosis (Borrmann type IV) adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

Lung cancer has the highest mortality of all cancers across the world.
Survival rates are much improved if the cancer is diagnosed and treated before the malignant cells have metastasized.
Patients diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer experience a 5-year survival rate of 52% which increases to 87.5% if platinum-based chemotherapy is part of the treatment.
While computed tomography (CT) scans are the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancer, CT has a 50% rate of false positives and, subsequently, a large number of unnecessary follow-up treatments.
An immunoassay has been developed that measures autoantibodies to lung cancer related antigens in the peripheral blood and may help lower the false positive rates of CT scans.
These antibodies include CAGE, GBU4-5, NY-ESO-1, p53, SOX-2, MAGE A4, and HuD and one or more of them are present in 40% of patients at the time lung cancer is diagnosed.
Which antibodies are positive may in the future provide a clue to what subtype of lung cancer the patient has developed.
Ongoing studies are investigating the utility of the antibodies being used as biomarkers for lung cancer in high risk asymptomatic patients.
There is also research investigating the changes in an individual's lung cancer antibody profile from their baseline values to predict early lung cancer development.
Regurgitation (also known as backflow) is a heart valve problem where, if a valve doesn't close tightly, blood leaks back into the chambers rather than flowing forward through the heart or into an artery.
Regurgitation, especially that of the mitral valve, is often due to prolapse, which is when the leaflets of the valve flop or bulge back into the heart chamber during systole.
The degree of regurgitation is associated with the extent of clinical symptoms.

Natural Killer (NK)-like T cells (abbreviated NKT, NK-T or NK-like T cells) express CD16+ and CD56+ as well as CD3+ and are a subgroup of T lymphocytes that have properties similar to NK cells.
They produce hormone-like substances, including cytokines and chemokines, in the presence of viral infections and tumor cells.
An increase in T-NK cells in the blood can occur in viral and malignant diseases, including HIV/AIDS and leukemias (e.g. T-large granular lymphocyte leukemia).
Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the outer-section (zona glomerulosa) of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland to regulate sodium and potassium balance in the blood.
It is synthesized from cholesterol by aldosterone synthase, which is absent in other sections of the adrenal gland.
It is the sole endogenous member of the class of mineralocorticoids.
Acting on mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) on principal cells in the collecting ducts of the kidneys, it increases the permeability of their apical (luminal) membrane to potassium and sodium and activates their basolateral Na+K+ pumps, stimulating ATP hydrolysis, reabsorbing sodium (Na+) ions and water into the blood, and excreting potassium (K+) ions into the urine.
Aldosterone also stimulates H+ secretion by intercalated cells in the collecting duct, regulating plasma bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels and its acidbase balance.
Fats consist of a wide group of compounds that are generally soluble in organic solvents and largely insoluble in water.
Chemically, fats are triesters of glycerol and fatty acids that may be either solid or liquid at room temperature, depending on their structure and composition.
Although the words "oils", "fats", and "lipids" are all used to refer to fats, "oils" is usually used to refer to fats that are liquids at normal room temperature, while "fats" is usually used to refer to fats that are solids at normal room temperature.
"Lipids" is used to refer to both liquid and solid fats, along with other related substances.
The word "oil" is used for any substance that does not mix with water and has a greasy feel, such as petroleum (or crude oil) and heating oil, regardless of its chemical structure.
Mesothelin, or MSLN, is a40 kDa protein that is encoded by the MSLN gene.
It is present on normal mesothelial cells and overexpressed in several human tumors, including mesothelioma and ovarian and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
The protein was first identified by its reactivity with monoclonal antibody K1.
Subsequent cloning studies showed that the mesothelin gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed to yield mesothelin which is attached to the cell membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol linkage and a 31-kDa shed fragment named megakaryocyte-potentiating factor (MPF).
Although it has been proposed that mesothelin may be involved in cell adhesion, its biological function is not known.
Myoglobin casts are seen in patients with myoglobinuria as a result of acute muscle damage, which may lead to acute renal failure.
Microscopically they appear much like a hemoglobin cast, but they are dark red to brown because of the myoglobin pigment.
Associated findings include a positive reagent-strip test for "blood" (actually myoglobin) without the presence of RBCs in the sediment.(Ringsrud 2001)
Deoxyinosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a deoxyribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a beta-N9-glycosidic bond.
Deoxyinosine is found in DNA while Inosine is found in RNA.
Inosine is a nucleic acid important for RNA editing.
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) catalyzes the conversion of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively.
ADA-deficient individuals suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and are unable to produce significant numbers of mature T or B lymphocytes.
This occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of ADA substrates or their metabolites.
Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotides reactions required for muscle movements.
When mapping be careful to distinguish the word pyridoxal (A is the 2nd to last letter) from pyridoxol (letter O is the 2nd to last letter).
These are both forms or preforms of vitamin B6.
Pyridoxine - the usual name for B6 is also called pyridoxol.
These both get converted to Pyridoxine 5-Phosphate the biologically active form (also called Pyridoxol 5-phosphate)
There are three natural forms of vitamin B6, pyridoxine (also called "pyridoxol") pyridoxamine and pyridoxal.
All of these forms are converted into a single biologically active form, pyridoxal 5-phosphate.
All three forms of vitamin B6 are heterocyclic organic compounds.
Green plants are a natural source of pyridoxal, and its deficiency in humans can lead to serious complications such as epilepsy and seizures.

Tra is a low incidence antigen of the Diego blood group system.
Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1) causes Newcastle disease, a contagious bird disease affecting many domestic and wild avian species.
Its effects are most notable in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility and the potential for severe impacts of an epizootic on the poultry industries.
It is endemic to many countries.
Exposure of humans to infected birds (for example in poultry processing plants) can cause mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms, but the Newcastle disease virus otherwise poses no hazard to human health.
Interest in the use of NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from the ability of NDV to selectively kill human tumour cells with limited toxicity to normal cells.
No treatment for NDV exists, but the use of prophylactic vaccines and sanitary measures reduces the likelihood of outbreaks.

Direct Antihuman Globulin (DAT) detects in vivo sensitivity of red blood cells using reagent specific for C3
The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is a measure of the percentage of sodium excreted in the urine versus the sodium reabsorbed by the kidney.
It is measured in terms of plasma and urine sodium, rather than by the interpretation of urinary sodium concentration alone, as urinary sodium concentrations can vary with water resorption.
Therefore the urinary and plasma concentrations of sodium must be compared to get an accurate picture of renal clearance.
In clinical use, the fractional excretion of sodium can be calculated as part of the evaluation of acute renal failure.
Allergy to beef is not very common and beef can often be tolerated by cow's milk-allergic patients.
Beef contains BSA and gamma-globulin, which are known heat-labile fractions in cow's milk, and differing clinical response to raw and well-cooked beef is shown in some millk-allergic patients.
Part of HLA-B57 allele family that is associated with Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction (AHSR)
Interferon-Î³ (interferon-gamma) release assays (IGRAs) are based on the ability of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens for early secretory antigen target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) to stimulate host production of interferon-gamma.
Because these antigens are not present in non-tuberculous mycobacteria or in any BCG vaccine variant, these tests can distinguish latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).
The blood tests QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB use these antigens to detect people with tuberculosis.
Lymphocytes from the patient's blood are incubated with the antigens.
If the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis before, T lymphocytes produce interferon Î³ in response.
These tests are both interferon Î³ tests but they are not equivalent.
The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube uses an ELISA format to quantify the total amount of interferon Î³ when whole blood is exposed to the antigens (ESAT-6,CFP-10 and TB 7.7).
T-SPOT.TB is a type of enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) assay, which counts the number of activated T lymphocytes that secrete interferon Î³.

Saltwort pollen commonly induces asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis in sensitised individuals.
There are many nuclear staining patterns seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, speckled, nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic.
The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and interphase chromatin stain and is associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to nucleosomal components, and anti-histone antibodies.
Most antibodies are IgG, but IgM and IgA have also been detected.
There are two speckled patterns: fine and coarse.
The fine speckled pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.
The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies.
The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To.

The Bloom syndrome gene product is related to the RecQ subset of DExH box-containing DNA helicases and has both DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activities.
Mutations causing Bloom syndrome delete or alter helicase motifs and may disable the 3'-5' helicase activity.
The normal protein may act to suppress inappropriate recombination.
Cathepsin A (Lysosomal protective protein) is encoded by the CTSA gene and active in lysosomes where it acts as a protease as well as a protective protein.
Patients deficient in cathepsin A due to mutations in the CTSA gene have symptoms of galactosialidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by combined deficiency of Î²-galactosidase and neuraminidase.
Normally, the protein forms a complex with neuraminidase 1 and elastin binding protein, forming the elastin binding protein receptor.
Many CTSA mutations disrupt the protein structure of cathepsin A, impairing its ability to join with these other proteins.
As a result, they are not functional or break down prematurely, which is thought to causes the signs and symptoms of galactosialidosis.[MedlinePlus Condition:
Isobutanol (IUPAC nomenclature: 2-methylpropan-1-ol) is an organic compound with the formula (CH3)2CHCH2OH.
This colorless, flammable liquid with a characteristic smell is mainly used as a solvent.

Mutations in the AIP gene cause 15 to 25 percent of cases of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), an inherited condition characterized by development of a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland (called a pituitary adenoma).
Many kinds of mutations in the AIP gene have been identified, some of which lead to an abnormally short protein or no protein at all.
Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in AIP.
Mutations in the AIP gene are found in a small percentage of individuals with sporadic macroadenomas, which are large (macro-) pituitary adenomas that occur in individuals with no history of the condition in their family.
Ethotoin (marketed as Peganone by Ovation) is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy.
It is a hydantoin, similar to phenytoin.
Ethotoin lacks phenytoin's side effects of gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism, however it is less effective.
This, combined with the need for frequent dosing has limited its usefulness.
Ethotoin is no longer widely used.

There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B and C. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease almost every winter in the United States.
The emergence of a new and very different influenza virus to infect people can cause an influenza pandemic.
Influenza type C infections cause a mild respiratory illness and are not thought to cause epidemics.
Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N).
There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes.
(H1 through H18 and N1 through N11 respectively.)
A viruses can be further broken down into different strains.
Current subtypes of influenza A viruses found in people are influenza A (H1N1) and influenza A (H3N2) viruses.
In the spring of 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1) virus (CDC 2009 H1N1 Flu website) emerged to cause illness in people.
This virus was very different from the human influenza A (H1N1) viruses circulating at that time.
The new virus caused the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years.
That virus (often called "2009 H1N1") has now replaced the H1N1 virus that was previously circulating in humans.
Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but can be further broken down into lineages and strains.
Currently circulating influenza B viruses belong to one of two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.
Chronic Cadmium toxicity causes Fanconi Syndrome and osteomalacia.
Increased beta 2 microglobulin in urine is sign of renal damage from cadmium toxicity.

The ANG gene (angiogenin, ribonuclease, RNase A family, 5) is located on chromosome 14q11.1-q11.2.The protein encoded by this gene is an exceedingly potent mediator of new blood vessel formation.
It hydrolyzes cellular tRNAs resulting in decreased protein synthesis and is similar to pancreatic ribonuclease.
In addition, the mature peptide has antimicrobial activity against some bacteria and fungi, including S. pneumoniae and C. albicans.
Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding the same protein.
This gene and the gene that encodes ribonuclease, RNase A family, 4 share promoters and 5' exons.
Each gene splices to a unique downstream exon that contains its complete coding region.
Mutations in ANG gene cause the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 9 phenotype.

It acts by inhibiting the initiation and elongation processes during protein synthesis.
Porcine teschovirus (PTV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus with thirteen known PTV serotypes that only infect pigs and wild boars.
Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, pneumonia, pericarditis and myocarditis though asymptomatic infections do occur.
Infection with some strains can lead to stillbirth, mummified fetus, embryonic death and infertility.
The porcine teschovirus-1 (PTV-1) serotype is the causative agent for teschovirus encephalomyelitis which is a disease with high morbidity and mortality in all age groups.
Infection with the PTV-2, -3 and -5 serotypes causes Talfan disease and has symptoms much milder than teschovirus encephalomyelitis and affects mostly younger pigs.
PTV can survive a wide range of pH which allows it to survive in liquid manure for extended periods of time.
PTV can be inactivated with sodium chlorite, by heating it in the presence of halide ions and with 70% ethanol.
PTV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
There have been no reports of swine to human transmission.
PTV-1 is known to have occurred in Europe, Africa, Haiti and Canada.
Infections with strains that produce milder symptoms have occurred worldwide.
PTV is diagnosed using virus neutralization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
A commercial vaccine against teschovirus encephalomyelitis has been developed, but because of the low incidence of infection is no longer available.
Food allergen mix 19 (fx19, FP19) detects cucumber (f244), carrot (f31), potato (f35), and spinach (f214) IgE antibodies.
Testing for IgE antibodies may be used to help diagnose an allergic disease or the cause of an anaphylactic episode in a patient.

A sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent that is metabolized in the liver to 1-hydrohexamide.
The FGB gene (fibrinogen beta chain) is located on chromosome 4q28.
The protein encoded by this gene is the beta component of fibrinogen, a blood-borne glycoprotein comprised of three pairs of nonidentical polypeptide chains.
Following vascular injury, fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to form fibrin which is the most abundant component of blood clots.
In addition, various cleavage products of fibrinogen and fibrin regulate cell adhesion and spreading, display vasoconstrictor and chemotactic activities, and are mitogens for several cell types.
Mutations in this gene lead to several disorders, including afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, hypodysfibrinogenemia and thrombotic tendency.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a protein that spans the cell membrane so is part outside of and part inside of the cell.
The external portion of the EGFR is able to bind individually to at least seven different ligands.
The EGFR-ligand complex then can bind to an adjacent receptor protein which then activates the EGFR-ligand complex and signals intercellular processes to promote cell growth, proliferation and survival.
The EGFR gene c.2369C>T mutation causes a substitution of threonine for methionine in the EGFR protein at position 790.
EGFR T790M mutation is present in 50-60% of patients resistant to the first and second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TK1) that are used heavily in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Once the EGFR T790M mutation is discovered the median survival of the patient is less than two years.
Fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, is primarily produced in bone and helps regulate phosphate and vitamin D metabolism by binding to receptors on renal tubular cells.
It is produced as a 251-amino acid precursor consisting of a signal peptide, N-terminal domain, and C-terminal domain.
The bioactive form of FGF23 consists of the N- and C-terminal domains after the signal peptide is removed, and is also called the "intact" form.
Serine endopeptidase pro-protein convertases cleave the intact form into inactive N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, though the C-terminal fragment may compete with intact FGF23 by binding to renal tubule receptors and thus play a role in regulating overall FGF23 activity.
The production of FGF23 is regulated by a variety of factors, including calcium and phosphate levels, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and iron deficiency.
Elevated FGF23 levels are associated with chronic kidney disease as well as cardiovascular disease.
Folate is involved in normal red cell maturation and used for the evaluation of macrocytic/megaloblastic anemia.
Folate red blood cell (RBC) measurements are used in identification of dietary folate deficiency that might be otherwise difficult to ascertain since serum folate concentration may rapidly rise to normal level after just one balanced meal whereas RBC folate increases more slowly.
RBC folate is usually not decreased as a consequence of iron deficiency and the evaluations of individuals with low serum folate and iron levels.

Classical swine fever (CSF) or hog cholera (also sometimes called pig plague based on the German word Schweinepest) is a highly contagious disease of pigs and wild boar.
It causes fever, skin lesions, convulsions and usually (particularly in young animals) death within 15 days.
The symptoms are indistinguishable from those of African swine fever.
The disease is endemic in much of Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Europe and Africa.
It was believed to have been eradicated in the United Kingdom by 1966 (according to the Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs), but an outbreak occurred in East Anglia in 2000.
It was eradicated in the USA by 1978, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
Other regions believed to be free of CSF include Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and Scandinavia.
The infectious agent responsible is a virus CSFV (previously called hog cholera virus) of the genus Pestivirus in the family Flaviviridae (or Togaviridae ).
Of the 100 different species included in the genus Pinus, almost all are found in the Northern Hemisphere, with 36 in North America.

It is associated with an approximately twofold change in response to pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (RBV) treatments, both among patients of European ancestry (p = 1.06 x 10e-25) and African-Americans (p = 2.06 x 10e-3).
Studies indicate that the virus was eradicated in ~80% of patients with wildtype alleles (C;C) compared to only about 25% of those with homozygous alleles (T;T).
Patient's with heterozygous alleles (C;T) had an intermediate response.
For HCV genotypes other than type 1 (HCV-1), the usefulness of predicting response to therapy based on this SNP is unknown.
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (A, B, and C) and II (DP, DM, DOA, DOB, DQ, and DR) in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system contains a large number of genes involved in immune system function in humans.
The proteins encoded by some genes form antigens.
HLA class I and II antigens are widely distributed on all nucleated cells and carried by platelets.
Antibodies specific to HLA class I and II antigens can be acquired through alloimmunization due to pregnancy, transfusion of blood products, or previous transplants.
Alloimmunization can lead to production of antibodies in approximately one third of individuals.
The presence of antibodies, specifically IgG, can affect the survival of transplant allografts or transfused platelets in sensitized individuals.
Various testing methods are used to detect antibodies to HLA antigens.

Actinomyces israelii is a species of Actinomyces.
Actinomycosis is most frequently caused by Actinomyces israelii and is sometimes known as the "most misdiagnosed disease," as it is frequently confused with neoplasms.
A. israelii is a normal colonizer of the vagina, colon, and mouth.
Infection is established first by a breach of the mucosal barrier during various procedures (dental, GI), aspiration, or pathologies such as diverticulitis.
The chronic phase of this disease is also known the "classic phase" because the acute, early phase is often missed by health care providers.
This is characterized by slow contiguous growth that ignores tissue planes and forms a sinus tract that can spontaneously heal and recur, leading to a densely fibrotic lesion.
This lesion is often characterized as "wooden.
"Sulfur" granules form in a central purulence surrounded by neutrophils.
This conglomeration of organisms is virtually diagnostic of Actinomyces israelii.
Oral-cervicofacial disease is the most common form of actinomycosis.
It is characterized by a painless "lumpy jaw.
Lymphadenopathy is uncommon in this form of the disease.
Another form of actinomycosis is thoracic disease, which is often misdiagnosed as a neoplasm, as it forms a mass that extends to the chest wall.
It arises from aspiration of organisms from the oropharynx.
Symptoms include chest pain, fever, and weight loss.
Abdominal disease is another manifestation of actinomycosis.
This can lead to a sinus tract that drains to the abdominal wall or the perianal area.
Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss.
Actinomyces sp. have also been shown to infect the central nervous system in a dog "without history or evidence of previous trauma or other organ involvement.

Arginine (symbol Arg or R) is an amino acid.
The L-form (L-arginine) is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids.
In mammals, arginine is classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individuals.
Infants are unable to effectively synthesize arginine, making it nutritionally essential for them.
Adults, however, are able to synthesize arginine in the urea cycle.
The body uses arginine for a variety of purposes, including boosting immune system function and improving blood flow.
Arginine sources include diet, medication, and/or nutritional supplements.
Dietary sources include meat, dairy products and fish.

This group of pathogens is a common cause of clinically important infections worldwide.
The CERKL gene (ceramide kinase-like) is located on chromosome 2q31.3.
This gene was initially identified as a locus (RP26) associated with an autosomal recessive form of retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) disease.
This gene encodes a protein with ceramide kinase-like domains, however, the protein does not phosphorylate ceramide and its target substrate is currently unknown.
This protein may be a negative regulator of apoptosis in photoreceptor cells.
Mutations in this gene cause a form of retinitis pigmentosa characterized by autosomal recessive cone and rod dystrophy (arCRD).
Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms and non-coding transcripts.

Trisomy 21 risk refers to the fetus's risk of having trisomy 21.
The risk can be estimated based on maternal age, prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA, various maternal lab tests, and fetal nuchal translucency or nuchal fold measurements.
Trisomy 21, also called Down syndrome, is caused by the presence of three copies of either the entire chromosome 21 or a crucial region of chromosome 21 in each cell rather than two.
Down syndrome is associated with cognitive delay, various forms of congenital heart disease, hearing loss, and leukemia, and characteristic physical features.
The risk for Down syndrome increases with increasing maternal age.
The general population risk of Down syndrome is 1 out of 650 to 1,000 live births; for a 30-year-old woman, the risk is 1 out of 1,000, while for a 40-year-old woman it nears 1 out of 100.
Studies have shown that Glycoproteins B (gB), gC and gD of pseudorabies virus (PRV) are antigens that can be utilized in protecting herds and cattle from PRV infection via cell-mediated immunity.
One particular study demonstrated DNA vaccine coding for gB of PRV induced cell-mediated immunity in pigs and reduced the amount of virus excreted.
Since the transmissoin of the virus occurs from exposure to nasal and oral excretions, vaccine coding for these glycoproteins may play an important role in reducing the spread of the disease.

The CDKN2A gene (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) is located on chromosome 9p21.
This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons.
At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase.
The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants.
This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53.
In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control.
This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.

The TF gene (coagulation factor III (thromboplastin, tissue factor)) is located on chromosome 1p22-p21.
This gene encodes coagulation factor III which is a cell surface glycoprotein.
This factor enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII.
The resulting complex provides a catalytic event that is responsible for initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis.
Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces.
There are 3 distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic.
This protein is the only one in the coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described.
Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
The SARS coronavirus is the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
On April 16, 2003, following the outbreak of SARS in Asia and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that the coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the official cause of SARS.
On April 12, 2003, scientists working at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia finished mapping the genetic sequence of a coronavirus believed to be linked to SARS.
The team was led by Dr. Marco Marra and worked in collaboration with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, using samples from infected patients in Toronto.
The map, hailed by the WHO as an important step forward in fighting SARS, is shared with scientists worldwide via the GSC website (see below).
Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, also called phosphatidylcholine-sterol O-acyltransferase) is an enzyme that converts free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester (a more hydrophobic form of cholesterol), which is then sequestered into the core of a lipoprotein particle, eventually making the newly synthesized HDL spherical and forcing the reaction to become unidirectional since the particles are removed from the surface.
The enzyme is bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) and low-density lipoproteins in the blood plasma.

Cathepsin S, also known as CTSS, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the CTSS gene.
The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the peptidase C1 family, is a lysosomal cysteine protease that may participate in the degradation of antigenic proteins to peptides for presentation on MHC class II molecules.
The encoded protein can function as an elastase over a broad pH range in alveolar macrophages.
Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this gene.
Cathepsin S has been shown to be a significant prognostic factor for patients with type IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma multiforme), and its inhibition has shown improvement in survival time by mean average 5 months.
This is because the cysteine enzyme can no longer act together with other proteases to break up the brain extracellular matrix.
So the spread of the tumor is halted.
Scientists have just announced that this enzyme predicts death, as it has been shown to be associated with both heart disease and cance
The SURF1 gene (surfeit 1) is located on chromosome 9q34.2.
This gene encodes a protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and thought to be involved in the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase complex.
The protein is a member of the SURF1 family, which includes the related yeast protein SHY1 and rickettsial protein RP733.
The gene is located in the surfeit gene cluster, a group of very tightly linked genes that do not share sequence similarity, where it shares a bidirectional promoter with SURF2 on the opposite strand.

Coproporhyrin I is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis.
Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life.
Coproporphyrin I is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphynogen, arising from heme synthesis and secreted in feces and urine.
Increased levels of coproporphyrins can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anaemia.
Porphyria is a pathological state characterised by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light.
A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: 1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, 2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, 3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course.
Hepatic factors includes disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss from, and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes, which may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine; decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion, so that the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio (1:III) becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function and intrahepatic cholestasis; and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are rare genetic disorders in which several genes (e.g. SNRPN, UBE3A) on chromosome 15(q11-13) are deleted or unexpressed.
Alterations in the PWS/AS region (15q11-13) may occur by several genetic mechanisms, including chance mutation, uniparental disomy, sporadic mutations, chromosome translocations, and gene deletions.
PWS and AS are some of the first reported instances of imprinting disorders in humans.
In PWS, the maternally inherited copies of genes are virtually silent due to imprinting.
Only the paternal copies of the genes are expressed.
Therefore, PWS results from the loss of paternal copies of this region.
Alternately, AS is caused by deletion or inactivation of genes on the maternally inherited chromosome 15 while the paternal copy, which may be of normal sequence, is imprinted and therefore silenced.
Characteristic features of PWS include diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, developmental delay, short stature, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, strabismus, and small hands and feet.
AS is characterized by intellectual and developmental disability, sleep disturbance, seizures, jerky movements (especially hand-flapping), frequent laughter or smiling, and usually a happy demeanor.

Increased vitamin B12 levels appear to be harmless.
Measurements of B12 identifies its deficiency.
This can arise from: defect in the secretion of intrinsic factor resulting in inadequate absorption from food (pernicious anemia), gastrectomy and malabsorption due to surgical resection, and a variety of bacterial or inflammatory diseases affecting the small intestine.
Langer-Giedion syndrome, also known as trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type II (TRPS2), involves the loss of functional copies of both the TRPS1 and EXT1 genes.
TRPS2 combines the clinical features of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I, caused by mutations in the TRPS1 gene on chromosome 8q23.3, and multiple exostoses type I, caused by mutations in the EXT1 gene on chromosome 8q24.11.
TRPS2 is associated with multiple dysmorphic facial features including laterally protruding ears, a bulbous nose, elongated upper lip, sparse scalp hair, winged scapulae, multiple cartilaginous exostoses, redundant skin, and various degrees of mental retardation, speech delay and hearing loss.
SynF is a capsule biosynthesis gene that uniquely identifies Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y from the other meningococcal serogroups.
There has been a large increase in the proportion of meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup Y since 1989.
In the mid-1990s, the incidence increased substantially in the United States (US) and during the past 10 years, it has also increased in Canada, Columbia and Norway.
A potential cause of this shift is the fact that the polysaccharide capsule based vaccine formulated for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y is ineffective against children under 2 years of age and has only been useful for outbreaks of the disease.
Recent vaccines for serogroups A and C have proven to be more effective in that age group which has led to serogroup Y being the most likely cause of pneumonia from Neisseria meningitidis.

The Val600Lys (V600K) mutation results in an amino acid substitution from a valine (V) to a lysine (K) in the BRAF gene (B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase).
The mutation causes a conformational change in the BRAF protein's G-loop activation segment of the kinase domain that makes it constitutively active and resistant to negative feedback signals.
The identification of V600* mutations and their effects have led to the creation of targeted therapeutics, including vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib for the treatment of V600-mutated melanoma.
The prevalence of V600 BRAF mutations that are V600K in melanoma tumors ranges across studies from 6-30%.
In addition to melanoma, BRAF mutations have been associated with a range of other cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), thyroid cancer, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and multiple myeloma.
Abrin is a natural poison that is found in the seeds of a plant called the rosary pea or jequirity pea.
These seeds are red with a black spot covering one end.
Abrin is similar to ricin, a toxin that is also found in the seeds of a plant (the castor bean plant).
However, abrin is much more poisonous than ricin.
Abrin can be made in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water.
Powdered abrin is yellowish-white in color.
Abrin is a stable substance, meaning that it can last for a long time in the environment despite extreme conditions such as very hot or very cold temperatures.
Abrin has some potential medical uses, such as in treatment to kill cancer cells.

The gene rearrangement that combines two or three gene segments to form a complete V-region exon generates diversity in two ways.
First, there are multiple different copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used in different rearrangement events.
This combinatorial diversity is responsible for a substantial part of the diversity of the heavy- and light-chain V regions.
Second, junctional diversity is introduced at the joints between the different gene segments as a result of addition and subtraction of nucleotides by the recombination process.
A third source of diversity is also combinatorial, arising from the many possible different combinations of heavy- and light-chain V regions that pair to form the antigen-binding site in the immunoglobulin molecule.
The two means of generating combinatorial diversity alone could give rise, in theory, to approximately 3.5 Ã 106 different antibody molecules.

Phenacemide is an anticonvulsant of the urea class.
Antiarrhythmic agent pharmacologically similar to LIDOCAINE.
It may have some anticonvulsant properties.
The biochemical nature of the antigens of the P blood group has been well defined.
P system antigens are formed by the addition of carbohydrates to the fatty acid chain of sphingolipids.
Because of the wide distribution of these antigens in nature, many of the antibodies to P system antigens result from immune response to other organisms.
The Donath-Landsteiner antibody, found in cases of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, has been thought to be such a response.
Many cases of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) in children are preceded by a flu-like illness or respiratory infection and are thought to be viral in nature.
In adults, the Donath-Landsteiner antibody may appear in transient association with syphilis.
It has been postulated that both the virus and spirochete carried a P-like carbohydrate structure that stimulates the autoantibody production.
Recently, another virus, parvovirus B19, has been associated with the P blood group system.
In healthy children, parvovirus B19 infection manifests itself with a malar rash while adult infection results in a mild flu-like illness.
The persons at greatest risk of developing complications due to B19 are those with sickle cell disease and thalassemia.
The rare phenotype for this system is known as p. Soon after the discovery of this phenotype it was noted that the naturally occurring antibodies in p females were a cause of early abortion.
Interestingly, the p phenotype is found more frequently in the Amish population.
A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary gland).
Thyrotropin stimulates the thyroid gland by increasing the iodide transport, synthesis and release of thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine).
Thyrotropin consists of two noncovalently linked subunits, alpha and beta.
Within a species, the alpha subunit is common in the pituitary glycoprotein hormones (TSH; Luteinizing hormone and FSH), but the beta subunit is unique and confers its biological specificity.
In 1900, Landsteiner observed that the red cells of some individuals were agglutinated by the serum of others and his detailed report a year later heralded the discovery of the first human blood groups.
His limited experiments on laboratory colleagues demonstrated three distinct groups; his pupils Von Decastello and Sturli discovered a fourth group in 1902.
It was 25 years before these groups were shown to be inherited as Mendelian characters by means of three allelomorphic genes A, B and O and were, in fact, entities of one blood group system.
For most of medicine this was considered a meaningless curiosity, but for those involved with the early development of transfusions it was quickly noted that transfusion of blood only of the same group could mean the difference between a successful outcome or a fatality.
While various nomenclatures have been used to describe these factors, it was internationally decided in the mid-1940's that the characteristics would be individually identified as A, B, AB and O and the blood group system know as ABO.
Since that time there have been billions of tests preformed and almost as many publications describing various aspects and associations of this blood group systems or its allelic products.
The genes controlling the ABO system are located on the long arm of chromosome 9 and encode for either an a (1-3) N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (for A) or a (1,3) galactosyltransferase (for B).
These transferases incorporate immunodominant sugars (GalNAc for A; Gal for B) on to one of four different types of oligosaccharide chains (type 2 is predominant on red cells, type 1 is found in secretions, plasma and some tissue) carried on glycosphingolipid or glycoprotein molecules.
The placement of the A and B antigens is dependent upon the existence of a substrate produced by the Hh blood group system (ISBT # 018).
Some individuals have weakened or variant expression of A and/or B which can be attributed to inheritance of variant forms of transferases.
Those individuals that have neither transferases, inheritors of two amorph genes, are group O. To date, 14 A alleles, 14 B alleles and 8 O alleles have been identified at the molecular level and more remain to be found.
The ABO antigens, as stated above are not restricted to the red blood cell membrane but can be found in saliva and all body fluids except spinal fluid if the individual has inherited a secretor gene.
The antigens are also found on most epithelial and endothelial cells.
It also appears on lymphocytes and platelets as it is adsorbed from the plasma.
Alterations of ABH expression have been found in various forms of cancer.
Furthermore, antigens of the ABO system may play a role in resistance to bacteria or viruses.

Coronavirus is a genus of animal virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae.
Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a helical symmetry.
Coronaviruses are grouped in the order Nidovirales, named for the Latin nidus, meaning nest, as all viruses in this order produce a 3' co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNA's during infection.
Proteins that contribute to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N).
Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.
Four to five different currently known strains of coronaviruses infect humans.
The most publicized human coronavirus, SARS-CoV which causes SARS, has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and can also cause gastroenteritis.
Coronaviruses are believed to cause a significant percentage of all common colds in human adults.
Coronaviruses cause colds in humans primarily in the winter and early spring seasons.
The significance and economic impact of coronaviruses as causative agents of the common cold are hard to assess because, unlike rhinoviruses (another common cold virus), human coronaviruses are difficult to grow in the laboratory
The Pumpkin is thought to have originated in Central America, possibly Mexico, but it is now grown widely in both temperate and tropical zones.
It is an annual climber, typically with a large, round, ribbed, edible orange fruit.
But Pumpkin comes in several other forms, such as the finer-textured, straw-colored Cheese pumpkin, the Gem squash and the Winter squash.
All of these have a hard, smooth rind, sometimes lightly ribbed, covering edible flesh and the central seed cavity.
Varieties within and between species can cross-pollinate to produce hybrids: hence the great number of shapes and sizes.
Pumpkins, however, can be differentiated from other squashes by their fruit stalk: it is angular and polygonal in Pumpkins but thick, soft and round in other squashes.
Pumpkin seeds are consumed as a snack in many cultures throughout the world and are especially popular in Central American countries, where strains have been selected primarily for edible seed use.
World production of the seed for food, on the other hand, is meagre.
Pumpkin can induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Dermatitis, asthma, rhinoconjuctivitis, itching of the mouth, angioedema of the face and lips, generalised itching and mild dyspnoea after eating Pumpkin soup or vermicelli made with Pumpkin have been reported in a patient.
Similar symptoms have been reported in 3 individuals after ingestion of roasted Pumpkin seed.
An osteoblast (from the Greek words for "bone" and "germ" or embryonic) is a mononucleate cell that is responsible for bone formation.
Osteoblasts produce osteoid, which is composed mainly of Type I collagen.
Osteoblasts are also responsible for mineralization of the osteoid matrix.
Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being reshaped by osteoblasts, which build bone, and osteoclasts, which resorb bone.
Osteoblast cells tend to decrease as individuals become elderly, thus decreasing the natural renovation of the bone tissue.
Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin is an alpha globulin glycoprotein that is a member of the serpin superfamily.
It inhibits the activity of certain enzymes called proteases, such as cathepsin G that is found in neutrophils, and chymases found in mast cells, by cleaving them into a different shape or conformation.
This activity protects some tissues, such as the lower respiratory tract, from damage caused by proteolytic enzymes.
This protein is produced in the liver, and is an acute phase protein that is induced during inflammation.
Deficiency of this protein has been associated with liver disease.
Mutations have been identified in patients with Parkinson disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The HEXB gene is located on chromosome 5q13.3 and encodes the beta subunit of beta-hexosaminidase, which is responsible for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides and other molecules containing terminal N-acetyl hexosamines.
Beta-hexosaminidase is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, which are encoded by the genes HEXA and HEXB, respectively.
Mutations in both HEXA and HEXB lead to an accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in neurons result in neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses.
HEXA mutations are associated with Tay-Sachs disease (GM2-gangliosidosis type I), and HEXB mutations are associated with Sandhoff disease (GM2-gangliosidosis type II).
In their classic forms, Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases are clinically indistinguishable and are characterized by the onset of progressive neurodegeneration in infancy, followed by paralysis, dementia, and death by age 3.
Alminoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), of the phenylpropionic acid class, having anti-inflammatory anti-exudative properties which mimic the action of dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid, and distinguishes alminoprofen from the classical NSAID.
Thiazides are diuretics, a class of drug that promote water loss from the body.
They inhibit Na +Cl - reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys.
Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid.
The chemical structure of the original thiazide diuretics contained a thiazide ring system; the term is also used for drugs with a similar action that are not chemically thiazides, such as chlortalidone and metolazone.
Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension.
They are the recommended first-line treatment in the US (JNC VII) guidelines and a recommended treatment in the European (ESCESH) guidelines.
They have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood.
They may cause vasodilation by desensitizing the vascular smooth muscle cells to calcium release induced by norepinephrine.
Side effects can include hypokalemia, increased serum cholesterol, and impotence.

Keratin refers to a family of fibrous structural proteins.
Keratin is the key of structural material making up the outer layer of human skin.
It is also the key structural component of hair and nails.
Some infectious fungi, such as those that cause athlete's foot and ringworm (i.e. the dermatophytes), or Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Chytrid fungus), feed on keratin.
Diseases caused by mutations in the keratin genes include Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens, Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, Steatocystoma multiplex, Keratosis pharyngis, Rhabdoid cell formation in Large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype.
Furthermore, keratin expression is helpful in determining epithelial origin in anaplastic cancers.

This test is used for the detection of vancomycin resistance genes by multiplex PCR.
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat various infections, primarily those caused by gram-positive bacteria.
Vancomycin resistance genes were first found in enterococci, and more recently have been found in Staphylococcus aureus.
The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) in hospitalized patients has lead to a restricted use of vancomycin.
To date, multiple vancomycin resistance genes have been characterized, including: vanA, vanB, vanC (vanC-1, vanC-2, vanC-3), and VanD.
Of the six van types, vanA and vanB are the most resistant to vancomycin, and are the two types that cause VRSA.
Bovine MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance (BMIS) is a dimeric glycoprotein that belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) family of growth and differentiation factors.
BMIS is produced by the Sertoli cells in males and causes regression of Mullerian ducts and continued development of the Wolffian ducts, which produce the vas deferens and epididymis.
In the absence of BMIS, the Mullerian ducts would form a uterus and oviducts.
In healthy female cattle, BMIS is produced by the granulosa cells of growing ovarian follicles and is an indicator of the total number of ovarian follicles and oocytes.
The level of BMIS in female cattle rises in the first few months of life and begins to decline until puberty.
When BMIS is not present, follicles mature at a much faster rate, which depletes the supply of follicles at an early age.
BMIS levels are associated with higher pregnancy rate, herd longevity, and response to superovulation and may be a valuable biomarker for fertility in cattle.
Zomepirac is an orally effective NSAID that has antipyretic actions.
It was developed by McNeil Pharmaceutical and approved by the FDA in 1980 and sold as the sodium salt, zomepirac sodium, under the brand name Zomax.
Due to its clinical effectiveness, it was preferred by doctors in many situations and obtained a large share of the analgesics market; however, it was subsequently withdrawn in March 1983 due to its tendency to cause serious anaphylaxis in an unpredictable subset of the patient population.

Interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL2RA gene.
The interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor alpha (IL2RA) and beta (IL2RB) chains, together with the common gamma chain (IL2RG), constitute the high-affinity IL2 receptor.
Homodimeric alpha chains (IL2RA) result in low-affinity receptor, while homodimeric beta (IL2RB) chains produce a medium-affinity receptor.
Normally an integral-membrane protein, soluble IL2RA has been isolated and determined to result from extracellular proteolyisis.
Alternately-spliced IL2RA mRNAs have been isolated, but the significance of each is currently unknown.
Infection by the protozoan trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, characterized by a reduction in the amount of IL2RA expressed on the surface of immune cells.
This leads to chronic immune suppression, becoming increasingly severe over the course of many years and ultimately resulting in death if left untreated.

Rabies virus (RV), is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus and a member of the Rhabdoviridae family.
It is transmitted when an animal infected with RV bites an individual or the saliva from an infected animal comes into contact with an open wound.
Once RV penetrates the muscle or connective tissue it begins to replicate and then infiltrates the peripheral nerves through the neuromuscular junction.
From there, RV spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the endoneurium of the Schwann cells.
If bitten by an animal that may have RV infection, rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine should be administered.
Otherwise, there is no treatment for infection by RV other than supportive care, and acute infection of the CNS is almost always fatal.
In countries where preventative care is not practiced, RV is still widespread.
In Asia, 30,000 people die annually from RV infection.
Diagnosis of RV is done on two tissue specimens from the brain that are analyzed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), mouse inoculation, tissue culture and polymerase chain reaction.

- Red Zone - with less than 50% best readings, or symptoms and treatment medications and seeking hospitalization and care.
Gemifloxacin mesylate (trade name Factive) is an oral broad-spectrum quinolone antibacterial agent used in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and mild-to-moderate pneumonia
The F12 gene (coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor)) is located on chromosome 5q35.3.
This gene encodes coagulation factor XII which circulates in blood as a zymogen.
This single chain zymogen is converted to a two-chain serine protease with an heavy chain (alpha-factor XIIa) and a light chain.
The heavy chain contains two fibronectin-type domains, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a kringle domain and a proline-rich domain, whereas the light chain contains only a catalytic domain.
On activation, further cleavages takes place in the heavy chain, resulting in the production of beta-factor XIIa light chain and the alpha-factor XIIa light chain becomes beta-factor XIIa heavy chain.
Prekallikrein is cleaved by factor XII to form kallikrein, which then cleaves factor XII first to alpha-factor XIIa and then to beta-factor XIIa.
The active factor XIIa participates in the initiation of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the generation of bradykinin and angiotensin.
It activates coagulation factors VII and XI.
Defects in this gene do not cause any clinical symptoms and the sole effect is that whole-blood clotting time is prolonged.
Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula HF.
It is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).
HF is widely used in the petrochemical industry and a component of many superacids.
HF boils just below room temperature whereas the other hydrogen halides condense at much lower temperatures.
Unlike the other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and it is particularly penetrating, which can damage the lungs.
Aqueous solutions of HF, called hydrofluoric acid, are strongly corrosive.

The GCK gene (glucokinase (hexokinase 4)) is located on chromosome 7p15.3-p15.1.
Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in most glucose metabolism pathways.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in three tissue-specific forms of glucokinase, one found in pancreatic islet beta cells and two found in liver.
The protein localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria.
In contrast to other forms of hexokinase, this enzyme is not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate but remains active while glucose is abundant.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2) and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI).
Blastomyces dermatitidis and Histoplasma capsulatum are dimorphic fungi that often cause self-limited respiratory infections, however they may also cause severe disseminated disease, depending on the level of the exposure to the organism and the host immune status.
Patients infected by these two fungi may have very similar clinical presentations, making identification important for patient care.
Primary infections are acquired through inhalation of microconidia that are present in the environment.
In the United States, most cases of blastomycosis and histoplasmosis occur along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys.
Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans.
Glucogonemia occurs in diabetes in which only moderate elevations of glucagon may occur.
HIgh levels (1,000-2,000 or greater) suggest glucogonoma in a diabetic.
The GJB6 gene (gap junction protein, beta 6, 30kDa) is located on chromosome 13q12.
Gap junctions allow the transport of ions and metabolites between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.
They are formed by two hemichannels, made up of six connexin proteins assembled in groups.
Each connexin protein has four transmembrane segments, two extracellular loops, a cytoplasmic loop formed between the two inner transmembrane segments, and the N- and C-terminus both being in the cytoplasm.
The specificity of the gap junction is determined by which connexin proteins comprise the hemichannel.
In the past, connexin protein names were based on their molecular weight, however the new nomenclature uses sequential numbers based on which form (alpha or beta) of the gap junction is present.
This gene encodes one of the connexin proteins.
Mutations in this gene have been found in some forms of deafness and in some families with hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are a class of enzymes that function to catalyze the initial step in each cycle of fatty acid Î² -oxidation in the mitochondria of cells.
Their action results in the introduction of a trans double-bond between C2 and C3 of the acyl-CoA thioester substrate.
FAD is a required co-factor in the mechanism in order for the enzyme to bind to its appropriate substrate.
Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases can be categorized into three distinct groups based on their specificity for short-, medium-, or long-chain fatty acid acyl-CoA substrates.
While different dehydrogenases target fatty acids of varying chain length, all types of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are mechanistically similar.
Differences in the enzyme occur based on the location of the active site along the amino acid sequence.
Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are an important class of enzymes in mammalian cells because of their role in metabolizing fatty acids present in ingested food materials.
This enzyme's action represents the first step in fatty acid metabolism (the process of breaking long chains of fatty acids into acetyl CoA molecules).
Deficiencies in these enzymes are linked to genetic disorders involving fatty acid oxidation (i.e. metabolic disorders).
RCS-4 N-(5-carboxypentyl) and RCS-4 N-(5-hydroxypentyl) are synthetic cannabis metabolites.

Although synthetic cannabinoids do not produce positive results in drug tests for cannabis, it is possible to detect the metabolites in human blood at a cutoff of 1.0 ng/mL.
The uidA gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme in some strains of E. coli.
The International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma (ICRB) is the newer retinoblastoma staging system, which takes into account what has been learned about the disease in recent decades.
Due to early diagnosis, extraocular spread of retinoblastoma has become less common, however, for cases with extraocular involvement, the most commonly used staging system is the Reese-Ellsworth staging system.
The ICRB divides intraocular retinoblastomas into 5 groups, labeled A through E, based on the chances that the eye can be saved using current treatment options.
Group A - Small tumors (3 mm across or less) that are only in the retina and are not near important structures such as the optic disc (where the optic nerve enters the retina) or the foveola (the center of vision).
Group B - All other tumors (either larger than 3 mm or small but close to the optic disc or foveola) that are confined to the retina.
Group C - Well-defined tumors with small amounts of spread under the retina (subretinal seeding) or into the jelly-like material that fills the eye (vitreous seeding).
Group D - Large or poorly defined tumors with widespread vitreous or subretinal seeding.
The retina may have become detached from the back of the eye.
Group E - The tumor is very large, extends near the front of the eye, is bleeding or causing glaucoma (high pressure inside the eye), or has other features that mean there is almost no chance the eye can be saved.
Found in patients with peroximal disease
Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a group of four distinct serotypes of single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family.
They are the second most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in younger children.
Repeated infection throughout the life of the host is not uncommon.
Symptoms of later breakouts include upper respiratory tract illness as in a cold and sore throat.
The incubation period of all four serotypes is 1 to 7 days.
Parainfluenza viruses can be detected via cell culture, immunofluorescent microscopy, and PCR.
Though no vaccines currently exist, research into vaccines for HPIV-1, -2, and -3 is underway.
Parainfluenza viruses last only a few hours in the environment and are inactivated by soap and water.

Barbiturates were first developed in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer and were widely distributed by the Farbwerke Fr Bayer and Co in 1904.
Barbiturates offered new treatment to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders profoundly improving their prognoses.
Barbiturates were also used to treat sleep disorders and were the first drugs to effectively treat epileptic seizures.
Due to safety concerns related to drug dependence and overdose and new safer psychoactive medications barbiturate use sharply declined in the 1950s.
Butabarbital is barbiturate used as a sleep aid and to relieve anxiety prior to surgical procedures.
Its affects are quickly felt but the length of their duration is short when compared to other barbiturates.
Butabarbital can be very dangerous when taken in conjunction with alcohol and as a result is seldom used clinically outside of Eastern European and South American countries.
Interleukin 5 or IL-5 is an interleukin produced by T helper-2 cells and mast cells.
Its functions are to stimulate B cell growth and increase immunoglobulin secretion.
It is also a key mediator in eosinophil activation.
IL-5 is a 115 amino acid (in man, 133 in the mouse) long TH2 cytokine which is part of the hematopoietic family.
Interleukin-5 is also expressed by eosinophils and has been observed in the mast cells of asthmatic airways by immunohistochemistry.
IL-5 expression is regulated by several transcription factors including GATA3.
Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod shaped, flagellated, aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, and a member of the genus Salmonella.
Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with S. enterica, which often infects cattle and poultry, though also other animals such as domestic cats and hamsters have also been shown to be sources of infection to humans.
However, investigations of vacuum cleaner bags have shown that households can act as a reservoir of the bacterium; this is more likely if the household has contact with an infection source, for example members working with cattle or in a veterinary clinic.
Raw chicken and goose eggs can harbor S. enterica, initially in the egg whites, although most eggs are not infected.
As the egg ages at room temperature, the yolk membrane begins to break down and S. enterica can spread into the yolk.
Refrigeration and freezing do not kill all the bacteria, but substantially slow or halt their growth.
Pasteurizing and food irradiation are used to kill Salmonella for commercially-produced foodstuffs containing raw eggs such as ice cream.
Foods prepared in the home from raw eggs such as mayonnaise, cakes and cookies can spread salmonella if not properly cooked before consumption.

The BMPR1A gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type IA) is located on chromosome 10q22.3.
The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors are a family of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases that include the type I receptors BMPR1A and BMPR1B and the type II receptor BMPR2.
These receptors are also closely related to the activin receptors, ACVR1 and ACVR2.
The ligands of these receptors are members of the TGF-beta superfamily.
TGF-betas and activins transduce their signals through the formation of heteromeric complexes with 2 different types of serine (threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50-55 kD and type II receptors of about 70-80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their respective type II receptors for ligand binding.
Carbapenems are broad-spectrum agents frequently used in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs.
In recent years, Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenems (i.e., carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CREs) have emerged, causing serious concern due to the increasingly limited treatment options.
Gene testing to determine the type(s) of carbapenemase resistance present helps with determining an appropriate treatment plan.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus.
There are four major HEV genotypes (genotypes 1 to 4) that comprise a single serotype.
Genotypes 1, 2 and 4 are associated with widespread outbreaks and are found in Asia and Africa, Mexico and west Africa, and Taiwan and China, respectively.
Genotype 3 is the cause of isolated cases in developed countries.
HEV infection targets the liver and is usually a self-limited, acute illness in immunocompetent patients, however, patients with solid organ transplants who are infected with HEV may develop chronic hepatitis.
In developing countries, the most common source of HEV is fecally-contaminated drinking water.
In developed countries, sporadic cases of HEV genotype 3 have occurred following consumption of uncooked or undercooked pork or deer meat and consumption of shellfish; zoonotic spread is possible though not common.
As of 2015, there is no FDA-approved vaccine for HEV in the U.S., but a recombinant vaccine was recently approved for use in China.
Free GABA levels may be elevated in the CSF of patients suffering from neurological diseases with inflammation and tissular necrosis such as cerebral cysticercosis.

Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine), benzoyl glycocoll or benzoyl amidoacetic acid, C9 H9 NO3 or C6 H5 CONHCH2 CO2 H, is an organic acid found in the urine of horses and other herbivores.
Its molecular weight is 179.175 and melting point range is 188-191ÂºC. High concentrations of hippuric acid can also indicate a toluene intoxication.
It is excreted when many aromatic compounds, such as benzoic acid and toluene, are taken internally.
Justus von Liebig in 1829 showed that it differed from benzoic acid, and in 1839 determined its constitution, while in 1873 Victor Dessaignes (Ann. 87, p. 325) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on zinc glycocollide.
It is also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine (Theodor Curtius, Ber., 1884, 17, p. 1662), and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid.
It crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187Â°C. and decompose at about 240Â°C.

The Common fig (Ficus carica) is a large, deciduous shrub or small tree native to southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region (from Afghanistan to Portugal).
Parathyrin 1-84 (PTH (1-84)) is the biologically active hormone that regulates the calcium and phosphate levels in the circulation.
PTH (1-84) is originally produced as a 118-amino acid polypeptide in the parathyroid glands.
It is cleaved twice to form a functional 84-amino acid peptide that is stored in the parathyroid cells.
The first 34 amino acids bind to the type 1 PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor that is expressed primarily in bone, kidney, cartilage, vessels, and certain developing organs.
The half-life of PTH (1-84) is 2-4 minutes, after which it is degraded into a carboxyl (C)- or amino (N)-terminal fragment.
The C-fragments have a half-life of 5-10 minutes, are cleared by the kidneys, and can accumulate in the circulation during chronic kidney disease.
Some evidence suggests that N-terminally truncated fragment PTH (7-84) may interact with receptors that regulate bone resorption and serum calcium concentrations that could lead to the quantification of other PTH fragments.
Rocio virus (ROCV) was isolated in 1975 during an outbreak of human encephalitis in Brazil.

An older medication used to treat schizophrenia, it is still prescribed, alongside newer agents such as olanzapine and quetiapine.
It has predominantly anticholinergic side effects, though extrapyramidal side effects are not uncommon either.
18 Beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) is a major metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid (glycyrrhizin), which is obtained from licorice and licorice root.
GRA inhibits 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta OHSD) which in turn inhibits the conversion of active cortisol to inactive cortisone in the kidneys.
This leads to high cortisol levels in the collecting duct of the kidney.
Patients often have high blood pressure with a low renin and low aldosterone blood level.
The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, unspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, hypokalaemia, high blood pressure and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Therefore licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension.
A species of gram-positive bacteria in the family Clostridiaceae, found in INTESTINES and SOIL.
The 11 Chinchillas brought to the US in 1923 to be the basis of commercial Chinchilla breeding there belonged to either the species Chinchilla laniger (long-tailed) or Chinchilla brevicaudata (short-tailed).

The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome 16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5 '- zeta - pseudozeta - mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'.
The alpha-2 (HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1) coding sequences are identical.
These genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated regions.
Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA, which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute HbA-2, which with HbF (fetal hemoglobin) makes up the remaining 3% of adult hemoglobin.
Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.
Bisphenol A, commonly abbreviated as BPA, is an organic compound with two phenol functional groups.
It is a difunctional building block of several important plastics and plastic additives.
Estrogens (also oestrogens) are a group of steroid compounds, named for their importance in the oestrus cycle, and functioning as the primary female sex hormone.
While estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age.
They promote the development of female secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts, and are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle.
The three major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estradiol, estriol and estrone.
From menarche to menopause the primary estrogen is estradiol 17beta.
In the body these are all produced from androgens through enzyme action.
Estradiol is produced from testosterone and estrone from androstenedione.
Estrone is weaker than estradiol, and in post-menopausal women more estrone is present than estradiol.
Bone density scanning (Also called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) or bone densitometry) is a procedure used to measure bone loss.
DXA is the standard for measuring bone mineral density (BMD), or the amount of bone matter per square centimeter of bone.
It is a non-invasive procedure involving minimal radiation exposure.
While measurements are typically made over the lumbar spine or proximal hip; the femur, radius/ulna, or calcaneus (heel) may be measured.
Results may be reported as: 1) Measured density reported in either g/cm2 (grams per centimeters squared) or mg/cm2 (milligrams per centimeters squared), 2) T-score, the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy young adult of the same gender as the patient, and with peak bone mass, and 3) Z-score, the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and gender (race and weight may optionally be included).
The most common reason for measuring bone density is to screen for and/or diagnose osteoporosis.
Limitations for this technique may include but are not limited to the size of the patient and thickness of tissue overlying the bone.

Interleukin-18 also known as IL18 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the IL18 gene.
The protein encoded by this gene is a proinflammatory cytokine.
IL-18 is able to induce severe inflammatory reactions, which suggests its role in certain inflammatory disorders.
Chromosome complex structural aberration analysis by cytogenetic methods can include spectral karyotyping (SKY), multiplex (M)-FISH and C-banding techniques to identify complex aberrations such as unbalanced translocations and chromosome rearrangements.
Both SKY and M-FISH involve "painting" each chromosome a different color using 24 unique fluorochromes and then using the colors to identify subtle structural variations that previously could not be detected.
C-banding is a technique that stains constitutive heterochromatin, which is present in centromeric and telomeric DNA, as well as specific other regions of certain chromosomes, such as the Y chromosome.
According to one study, M-FISH has been able to identify chromosome abnormalities in up to 7% of patients with previously unexplained mental retardation.
Complex structural aberration analysis can be the next step in evaluation when an abnormality is detected but cannot be further identified using more common methods, and the advanced methodologies are being utilized in different domains, including prenatal diagnosis as well as solid and hematologic malignancies.
Patients who are sensitized to chicken meat may react also to turkey meat.
Complement Factor B present during primary activation of complement system via the alternative pathway is occuring when C3 and PFB are decreased and C4 is normal.

Sulfites are counted among the top nine food allergens, but a reaction to sulfite is not a true allergy.
It may cause breathing difficulty within minutes after eating a food containing it, or migraines.
Asthmatics and possibly people with salicylate sensitivity (or aspirin sensitivity) are at an elevated risk for reaction to sulfites.
The reaction can, but not often, be fatal, and the individual must immediately go to the emergency room.
Other symptoms include sneezing, swelling of the throat, and hives.
Disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) is the main component of pulmonary surfactant.
Disaturated phosphatidylcholine is formed from phosphatidylcholine plus two saturated fatty acids, usually palmitate.

Intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) are two of the five major groups of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream.
IDL is a triglyceride rich, apo B-containing, lipoprotein intermediate in density and size between LDL and VLDL.
VLDL is assembled in the liver from cholesterol and apolipoproteins.
When the triglycerides in VLDL are removed by lipoprotein lipase, VLDL is converted to a smaller particle with a new name, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL).
Moderately increased levels of IDL and VLDL cholesterol are closely associated with coronary artery disease.
Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia, which may be linked to depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage.
Isoleucine is one of the 20 basic amino acids, and forms part of the structure of almost all proteins.
It is coded for in DNA.
Its chemical composition is identical to that of leucine, but the arrangement of its atoms is slightly different, resulting in different properties.
Nutritionally, in humans, isoleucine is an essential amino acid.
Isoleucine is a hydrophobic amino acid.
Its three letter code is ILE and its one letter code is I. Isoleucine has two chiral centers; therefore there are four possible stereoisomers of isoleucine and two possible diastereomers of L-isoleucine.
However, isoleucine present in nature exists in one enantiomeric form, (2 S ,3 S)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid.
Rich sources of isoleucine are eggs, chicken, pork, mutton, pulses, soya beans, cottage cheese, milk, piyal seeds, cashew nuts, and cereal grains.

Other strains previously classified in the genus Pseudomonas are now classified in the genera Burkholderia and Ralstonia.
Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside.
It has similar structure and effects to digoxin (though the effects are longer-lasting).
Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so could be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function.
However, it is now rarely used in current UK medical practice.
Whilst there have been several controlled trials which have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, there is not the same strong evidence base for digitoxin, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.
Toxicity:Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to the more-commonly used digoxin, namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias.
Anti-digoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity.

Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
Peanut agglutinin (PNA) is plant lectin protein derived from the fruits of Arachis hypogaea.
Peanut agglutinin may also be referred to as Arachis hypogaea lectin.
Lectins recognise and bind particular sugar sequences in carbohydrates; peanut agglutinin binds the carbohydrate sequence Gal-Î²(1-3)-GalNAc.
The name "peanut agglutinin" originates from its ability to stick together (agglutinate) cells, such as neuramidase-treated erythrocytes, which have glycoproteins or glycolipids on their surface which include the Gal-Î²(1-3)-GalNAc carbohydrate sequence.
Because peanut agglutinin specifically binds a particular carbohydrate sequence it finds use in a range of methods for cell biology and biochemistry.
For example in PNA-affinity chromatography the binding specificity of peanut agglutinin is used to isolate glycosylated molecules which have the sugar sequence Gal-Î²(1-3)-GalNAc.
Peanut agglutinin activity is inhibited by lactose and galactose which compete for the binding site.
Other uses include Potent anti-T cell activity, distinguishing between human lymphocyte subsets, tumour tissue determination for transitional mucosa malignancies, identification of mammalian-infective metacyclic promastigote Leishmania major parasites from other life cycle forms also found in the sandfly host.

The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is an index of sleep apnea severity that combines apneas and hypopneas.
The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and are associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation.
Combining these gives an overall sleep apnea severity score that evaluates both number sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation (low blood level).
The AHI, as with the separate apnea index and hypopnea index, is calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of hours of sleep.
(AHI values are typically categorized as 5-15/hr = Mild; 15-30/hr = Moderate; and > 30/h = Severe.)

Crystals are formed in urine when solutes precipitate out of solution.
Crystals are typically absent in freshly voided urine.
Normally they precipitate as the urine cools or after it is refrigerated.
Most crystals are not indicative of a pathological process, but when present in freshly voided urine, they indicate that crystals are forming within the body which is clinically important.
When crystals develop within the nephrons, serious tubular damage is possible.
Since the presence of some crystals in the urine are considered pathological, it is crucial that they be correctly identified and reported.
Crystal identification is made based on microscopic physical appearance and urine pH.

The BMPR1A gene encodes the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A protein.
More than 60 mutations in the BMPR1A gene have been found to cause juvenile polyposis syndrome.
Most BMPR1A gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein.
As a result, the BMPR1A protein cannot bind to ligands in the TGF-Î² pathway.
This disruption in binding interferes with the activation of the SMAD protein complex.
This inactive complex is not transported to the nucleus, where it is needed to regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.
Unregulated cell growth can lead to polyp formation in people with juvenile polyposis syndrome.

Longitudinal imaging planes may include four chamber, two chamber, and long axis, which correspond to the standard apical four-chamber, apical two-chamber, and apical long-axis views used for echocardiography.
Global longitudinal strain (GLS) may be generated from both speckle-tracking echocardiography and the newer semi-automated feature-tracking cardiac magnetic resonance (FT CMR) software applied to routine clinical steady-state free precession imaging.
These rapid and reproducible measures of GLS may detect serial changes in myocardial function using CMR or echocardiography, which are important for following progression of disease or response to medical interventions.
GLS is a sensitive predictor of prognosis for patients with cardiac amyloidosis, and impaired GLS is related to unfavorable cardiovascular events in heart failure patients.
Values for normal longitudinal strain are negative.
Amphetaminil (Aponeuron, AN-1) is a stimulant drug derived from amphetamine, which was developed in the 1970s and used for the treatment of obesity, ADHD, and narcolepsy.
It has largely been withdrawn from clinical use following problems with abuse.
The PLP1 gene (proteolipid protein 1) is located on chromosome Xq22.
This gene encodes a transmembrane proteolipid protein that is the predominant myelin protein present in the central nervous system.
It may play a role in the compaction, stabilization, and maintenance of myelin sheaths, as well as in oligodendrocyte development and axonal survival.

Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms or having different 5' UTRs, have been identified for this gene.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae are gram-negative cocci usually seen in pairs with the adjacent sides flattened.
Pili, filament-like appendages, extend from the cell surface and have a role in adherence.
Gonorrhea is usually acquired by sexual contact.
Men and women aged 15-29 have the highest incidence of gonorrhea.
Number of sexual partners, sexual practices and preference, condom use and population mobility contribute to disease incidence.
The most frequent sites are the cervix, urethra, rectum, pharynx and conjunctiva.
The most common symptom in men is discharge that may be scanty and clear or cloudy to copious and purulent, and often dysuria.
Asymptomatic men are an important reservoir for transmission.
Endocervical infection is the most common form of infection in women.
Ocular infections occur most commonly in newborns who are exposed in the birth canal and can lead to corneal scarring or perforation.
Gonococcal bacteremia may lead to disseminated infection including pelvic inflammatory disease in as many as 15 percent of women, leading to an increased probability of infertility and ectopic pregnancy.
While antibiotics have successfully treated gonorrhea for decades, N. gonorrhoeae has developed antimicrobial resistance to every drug used for treatment.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends combination therapy using two antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action (e.g., a cephalosporin plus azithromycin) to improve treatment efficacy and potentially slow the spread of resistance to cephalosporins.
The chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) gene is located on chromosome 3p21.
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of G to A at position 190 changes amino acid valine (GTC) to isoleucine (ATC) within codon 64 (CCR2-V64I).
This change is associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals, renal transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis and development of breast cancer.
The CCR2-V64I polymorphism may also reduce the risk of cervical cancer in some women, but study findings are conflicting.

Plasma 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) is an excellent marker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Currently, it is the only marker able to detect heterozygous carriers with 21-hydroxylase deficiency after Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) stimulation.
The syndrome of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises the spectrum of autosomal recessive enzymatic disorders that impair cortisol biosynthesis.
The hormonal pattern and clinical manifestations result from hyperstimulation of the adrenal cortex by excessive production of ACTH, untied from the negative feedback exerted by reduced cortisol levels, and the ultimate accumulation of F precursors and androgens.
These abnormalities predispose the female newborn to ambiguous genitalia (female pseudohermaphroditism) and precocious puberty that may occur in both sexes.
CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) comprises nearly 90% of all cases, with an estimated worldwide incidence of 1 in 14,000 live births.
Because 21-deoxycortisol (21DF) is an 11b-hydroxylase (11bOH) derivative of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), its serum levels are parallel and proportionally elevated in patients with 21OHD but decreased or undetectable in those with 11b-hydroxylase deficiency (11bOHD).
Due to the marked buildup of 17OHP in 21OHD, this precursor steroid can proceed directly to 11-hydroxylation, producing distinct elevations of 21DF. ,
Lactulose is a synthetic, non-digestible sugar used in the treatment of chronic constipation and hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease.
It is a disaccharide (double-sugar) formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose.
It is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose and is broadly classified as an osmotic laxative.
In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced kidney function, excess lactulose dosage can result in dehydration and electrolytic disturbances such as high sodium levels.

High levels of 5a-tetrahydrocorticosterone are a warning sign of hypertension.
Pivalate ester analog of AMPICILLIN.
Cortisol is a glucocorticoid produced in the adrenal cortex.
A synthetic version of this same chemical is called hydrocortisone and manufactured as medication.
Cortisol is not to be confused with cortisone, a closely related compound with much less (PubChem calls it "inactive") biologic activity.
Cortisone is also offered as a drug, and it is converted to cortisol (the active form) in the liver.
They both have a circadian rhythm with peak in the AM (around 8AM) and trough in the evening (around midnight), but this shifts according to sleep habits (work shifts).
The morning measurement, which should be high, is most useful for diagnosing Addison's disease (too little cortisol) and the evening measurement, which should be low, is the most useful for diagnosing Cushing's disease (too much cortisol).
Salivary cortisol may be a more sensitive measure than serum or plasma.
Natural metabolic intermediary of cortisol
Gluten is a general name for the proteins gliadin and glutenin that are found in wheat (durum, emmer, spelt, farina, farro, Kamut, khorasan, wheat and einhorn), rye, barley, and triticale.
Gluten gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and to keep its shape, and often gives the final product a chewy texture.
Some people are gluten-intolerant, meaning their bodies produce an abnormal immune response breaking down gluten during digestion.
Gluten-related disorders is an umbrella term for diseases triggered by gluten, which include coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis.
Methandrostenolone (metandienone, methandienone, Averbol, Dianabol, Danabol, DBOL) is an orally-effective anabolic steroid.

The enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, also known as UDP-galactose 4-epimerase or GALE, is a homodimeric epimerase found in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells.
This enzyme performs the final step in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism, catalyzing the reversible conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose.
GALE tightly binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a co-factor required for catalytic activity.
Additionally, human and some bacterial GALE isoforms reversibly catalyze the formation of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in the presence of NAD+, an initial step in glycoprotein or glycolipid synthesis.
Human GALE deficiency or dysfunction results in Type III galactosemia, which may exist in a mild (peripheral) or more severe (generalized) form.
Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) is an islet beta-cell secretory membrane protein.
ZnT8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A) are present in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and are a marker for disease.
When combined with established autoantibody markers, including glutamate decarboxylase (GADA), protein tyrosine phosphatase IA2 (IA2A), antibodies to insulin (IAA), and islet cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ICA), the ZnT8 antibody test improves diagnostic sensitivity in suspected cases of type 1 DM.
The detection of plasma or blood ketosterol bile acid precursors, specifically 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-3-one, is sensitive for the diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis that causes neurodegeneration and premature death.
CTX is associated with a deficiency in the mitochondria enzyme, sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), which converts cholesterol to bile acids.
Symptoms include diarrhea and juvenile cataracts in children, progressing to tendon and cerebral xanthomas with neurological deterioration and death.
Because there is an effective therapy (oral replacement of chenodeoxycholic acid, the main bile acid deficient in CTX), it is critical to diagnose as early as possible.
Prior to the more sensitive ketosterol bile acid precursors, diagnosis had depended on measurement of elevated 5-alpha-cholestanol .

Enterococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes.
Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone.
Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: E. faecalis (90-95%) and E. faecium (5-10%).
Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, including E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. raffinosus.
Important clinical infections caused by Enterococcus include urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis.
Sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with ampicillin and vancomycin.
From a medical standpoint, an important feature of this genus is the high level of intrinsic antibiotic resistance.
Some enterococci are intrinsically resistant to Î²-lactam-based antibiotics (penicillins,cephalosporins,carbapenems), as well as many aminoglycosides.
In the last two decades, particularly virulent strains of Enterococcus that are resistant to vancomycin (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or VRE) have emerged in nosocomial infections of hospitalized patients, especially in the US.
Other developed countries, such as the UK, have been spared this epidemic, and, in 2005, Singapore managed to halt an epidemic of VRE.
VRE may be treated with quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) with response rates of approximately 70%.
Tigecycline has also been shown to have anti-enterococcal activity as has rifampicin.
Enterococcal meningitis is a rare complication of neurosurgery.
It often requires treatment with intravenous or intrathecal vancomycin, yet it is debatable as to whether its use has any impact on outcome: the removal of any neurological devices is a crucial part of the management of these infections.
New epidemiological evidence has shown that enterococci are major infectious agent in chronic bacterial prostatitis.
Enterococci are able to form biofilm in the prostate gland making their eradication difficult.
The Powassan virus is a tick-borne encephalitis virus related to the classic TBE flavivirus.

Hepatitis A virus (Hep A or HAV) is an RNA virus that causes an acute infectious disease of the liver and is usually spread by the fecal-oral route.
It is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water or through direct contact with an infectious person.
In developing countries, and in regions with poor hygiene standards, the incidence of infection with this virus is high.
HAV infection produces a self-limited disease that usually does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease.
Overall occurrence acute liver failure from Hepatitis A is rare (approx. 0.5%).
The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with >80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection.
Antibody produced in response to HAV infection persists for life and confers protection against reinfection.
The disease can be prevented by vaccination, and hepatitis A vaccine has been proven effective in controlling outbreaks worldwide.
Although HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the incubation period, specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific IgM antibodies in the blood.
IgM antibody is only present in the blood following an acute hepatitis A infection.
It is detectable from one to two weeks after the initial infection and persists for up to 14 weeks.
The presence of IgG antibody in the blood means that the acute stage of the illness is past and the person is immune to further infection.
IgG antibody to HAV is also found in the blood following vaccination and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of this antibody.
In congenital form of angioedema there is a deficiency in C-1 esterase inhibitor detectable by nephelometry.
Acquired forms are usually associated with qualitative (functional) deficiency of the inhibitor.

Side effects are primarily self-limited and include nausea, headache, and abdominal pain.
Ethylene (or IUPAC name ethene) is the chemical compound with the formula CH2 CH2.
It is the simplest alkene.
Because it contains a double bond, ethylene is called an unsaturated hydrocarbon or an olefin.
It is exceedingly important in industry and even has a role in biology as a hormone.
Ethylene is the organic compound produced on the largest scale: global production of ethylene exceeded 75,000,000 metric tonnes per year in 2005.
Globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) is the deacylated, cationic, amphiphilic glycolipid product of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3).
Gb3, lyso-Gb3, and an un-described additional metabolite of Gb3 are markedly increased in the plasma of male patients with classic Fabry disease.
Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A due to a mutation in the alpha-galactosidase A gene on the X chromosome.
It leads to renal insufficiency, cardiac hypertrophy, and neuropathy that is thought to be due to the accumulation of Gb3 in the endothelium.
However, treatment of Fabry disease with enzyme therapy decreases the Gb3 in the endothelium, but does not eliminate disease symptoms to the degree expected.
In addition, plasma and urinary levels of Gb3 do not correlate with disease severity which suggests little or no correlation of the plasma level of Gb3 and the cause of disease.
The plasma levels that do correlate with symptoms of disease are lyso-Gb3.
Lyso-Gb3 is present in the plasma of Fabry patients in much higher levels than Gb3.
It is believed to inhibit the activity of alpha-galactosidase A, promote the storage of Gb3, and induce the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vitro.
In Fabry disease, there is known accelerated hypertrophy of the walls of the radial artery and a thickening of the intima media of the common carotid artery as a result of smooth muscle cell proliferation.

Valine is a primary marker for Maple syrup urine disease, Valinemia
CD5 is a cluster of differentiation found on a subset of IgM secreting B cells called B-1 cells, and also on T cells.
B1 B cells have limited diversity of their B Cell Receptor (BCR) due to their lack of the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and are potentially self-reactive.
CD5 serves to mitigate activating signals from the BCR so that the B1 cells can only be activated by a very strong stimuli (such as bacterial proteins) and not by normal tissue proteins.
CD5 was used as a T cell marker until mABs against CD3 were developed.
In humans, the gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 11.

Geobacillus stearothermophilus is a rod-shaped, gram-positive bacteria commonly used as a biological indicator for sterilization in labs.
Because G. stearothermophilus are thermophillic, they are highly resistant to heat and therefore used in equipment validation studies to prove that sterilization took place.
G. stearothermophilus was first described as Bacillus stearothermophilus, but was reclassified as a member of the genus Geobacillus in 2001 based on comparative analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences and fatty acid compositions of isolates.
Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine) is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide used to kill weeds, especially perennials.
It is typically sprayed and absorbed through the leaves, injected into the trunk, or applied to the stump of a tree, or broadcast or used in the cut-stump treatment as a forestry herbicide.
Kell is highly polymorphic.
It has two major codominant alleles, k and K, which result from a SNP (698CâT), and the corresponding k and K antigens differ by a single amino acid change (T193M).
Mostly IgG antibodies, so IgM is uncommon.
Anti-K does not bind complement.
If hemolysis does occur, it is extravascular in nature.
Anti-K can cause a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction and severe fetal anemia.
In the RBC membrane, the Kell glycoprotein is covalently linked to the XK protein, a multipass membrane protein thought to have a role in transport.
In the absence of XK, a condition called McLeod syndrome, Kell antigens are only weakly expressed and the RBCs are abnormal with spiky projections (acanthocytosis).
Systemic findings include muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, psychiatric disturbances, and neurological defects, such as loss of reflexes and movement disorders.
The frequency of K antigens is 2% in Blacks, 9% in Caucasians, up to 25% in Arabs populations.

The natural range of the honeybee is thought to be Africa, Europe and the Middle East for A. mellifera and Japan, India and Indochina for A. cerona.
Honeybees have been domesticated and spread throughout the world.
Honeybee is the only stinging Hymenoptera that almost always leaves its fluked stinger in the skin of the victim.
The venom continues to pump into the victim until the venom sac is exhausted or the stinger removed.
Venoms from honeybees and bumblebees are reported to be highly cross-reactive, which is consistent with the degree of structural similarity in the phospholipases, phospholipase A2.
The hyaluronidases and phosphatases also have a high degree of similarity in honeybees and bumblebees.
There are over 100 species of horse and deer flies.
Deer flies (Chrysops spp., 33 species) range from 1/4 to Â½ inch long, black to brown in coloration, often with yellowish markings.
They characteristically have clear wings with black or brown patterns, making wings appear to be banded.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a virus in the family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales.
The well-known Rabies virus belongs to the same family.
VSV can infect insects and mammals.
It is a common laboratory virus used to study the properties of viruses in the Rhabdoviridae family, as well as to study virus evolution.
VSV is an arbovirus:Natural VSV infections encompass two steps, cytolytic infections of mammalian hosts and transmission by insects.
In insects, infections are non-cytolytic persistent.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is the prototypic member of the Vesiculovirus genera of the Rhabdovirus family.
The genome of the virus is a single molecule of negative-sense RNA that encodes five major proteins: glycoprotein (G), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein, large protein (L) and phosphoprotein.
Half the genome encodes the L protein, which combines with the phosphoprotein to catalyze replication of the mRNA.
Myristic acid, also called tetradecanoic acid or 14:0 is a common saturated fatty acid with the molecular formula CH3(CH2)12COOH.
A myristate is a salt or ester of myristic acid.
Myristic acid is named after the nutmeg Myristica fragrans.
Nutmeg butter is 75% trimyristin, the triglyceride of myristic acid.
Besides nutmeg, myristic acid is also found in palm kernel oil, coconut oil, butter fat and is a minor component of many other animal fats.
It is also found in spermacetin, the crystallized fraction of oil from the sperm whale.
Myristic acid is also commonly added co-translationally to the penultimate, nitrogen-terminus, glycine in receptor-associated kinases to confer the membrane localisation of the enzyme.
The myristic acid has a sufficiently high hydrophobicity to become incorporated into the fatty acyl core of the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of the eukaryotic cell.
In this way, myristic acid acts as a lipid anchor in biomembranes.
The ester isopropyl myristate is used in cosmetic and topical medicinal preparations where good absorption through the skin is desired.
Reduction of myristic acid yields myristyl aldehyde and myristyl alcohol.

The Highlands J (HJ) virus is a zoonotic alphavirus native to North and South America.
It maintains a natural reservoir in the songbird population of freshwater swamps (generally scrub jays and blue jays) and is transmitted by the bite of the female Culiseta melanura mosquito.
Though nearly identical in structure and natural cycle to the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, it is considerably less virulent than its cousin, causing relatively mild symptoms in its primary avian reservoir and only nominally capable of transmission to mammals.
A 1995 study conducted in Florida swampland found that 15% of swamp-dwelling jays tested positive for HJ antibodies, all of which were asymptomatic and in apparent good health.
Recorded bird deaths from HJ infection are uncommon but not rare, and include several domestic turkeys at a commercial facility and young broiler chickens in an experimental setting.
Transmission to equines or humans via mosquito is also possible, though even more rare.
Despite its negligible virulence in humans, it is often tested for in US domestic mosquito control programs as an indicator of fruitful conditions for other mosquito-borne zoonoses to multiply.
Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a recreational drug with euphoric, stimulant properties.
The effects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by amphetamine.
Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity, and seizures.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is categorized into two types, HIV-1 and HIV-2.
Worldwide, most HIV infections are HIV-1, whereas HIV-2 largely has been confined to persons in or from West Africa (1,2).
HIV-1 and HIV-2 have the same routes of transmission, and both can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (3); however, HIV-2 infections should be differentiated from HIV-1 infections because they are less likely to cause AIDS and their clinical management differs (4,5).
CDC's current surveillance case definition for HIV infection applies to both variants of HIV (6) but lacks criteria for differentiating between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
To enumerate and describe HIV-2 cases reported in the United States, a working case definition was developed.
During 1988 through June 2010, a total of 242 HIV-2 cases were reported to CDC.
Of these, 166 met the working definition.
These HIV-2 cases were concentrated in the Northeast (66%, including 46% in New York City) and occurred primarily among persons born in West Africa (81%).
Ninety-seven of the HIV-2 cases also had a positive HIV-1 immunoblot antibody test result (e.g., Western blot).
Immunoblot antibody tests currently used to confirm HIV reactive screening tests do not contain reagents specific to HIV-2 and thus are not reliable for identification of HIV-2 infections (7).
Additional testing specific to HIV-2 should be considered if HIV-1 test results are atypical or inconsistent with clinical findings, especially for persons from West Africa.
If an HIV case is reported to the health department but subsequently identified as HIV-2, health-care providers should update the case report to reflect the correct type.
As of June 2012, the Bio-Rad Multispot HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test is FDA approved for distinguishing HIV1 from HIV2.
The MYC gene (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) is located on chromosome 8q24.21.
The protein encoded by this gene is a multifunctional, nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation.
It functions as a transcription factor that regulates transcription of specific target genes.
Mutations, overexpression, rearrangement and translocation of this gene have been associated with a variety of hematopoietic tumors, leukemias and lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma.
There is evidence to show that alternative translation initiations from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site result in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.
The synthesis of non-AUG initiated protein is suppressed in Burkitt's lymphomas, suggesting its importance in the normal function of this gene.
Vitamin E is found naturally in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
"Vitamin E" is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities.
Naturally occurring vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity. Alpha-
(or Î±-) tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements.
Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that stops the production of reactive oxygen species formed when fat undergoes oxidation.
In addition to its activities as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes.
Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals.

The AS gene (major histocompatibility complex, class I, B) gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3.
HLA-B belongs to the HLA class I heavy chain paralogues.
This class I molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain (beta-2 microglobulin).
The heavy chain is anchored in the membrane.
Class I molecules play a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.
They are expressed in nearly all cells.
The heavy chain is approximately 45 kDa and its gene contains 8 exons.
Exon 1 encodes the leader peptide, exon 2 and 3 encode the alpha1 and alpha2 domains, which both bind the peptide, exon 4 encodes the alpha3 domain, exon 5 encodes the transmembrane region and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail.
Polymorphisms within exon 2 and exon 3 are responsible for the peptide binding specificity of each class one molecule.
Typing for these polymorphisms is routinely done for bone marrow and kidney transplantation.
Hundreds of HLA-B alleles have been described.

Taenia is a genus of tapeworm that includes some important parasites of livestock.
Members of the genus are responsible for taeniasis and cysticercosis in humans.
There are more than 100 species recorded.
They are morphologically characterized by a ribbon-like body composed of a series of segments called proglottids; hence the name Taenia (Greek tainia meaning ribbon, bandage or stripe).
The anterior end of the body is the scolex.
Not all members of the genus Taenia have an armed scolex (hooks and/or spines located in the "head" region), for example, Taenia saginata has an unarmed scolex, while Taenia solium has an armed scolex.
Proglottids have central ovary, with a vitellarium (yolk gland) posterior to it.
As in all cyclophyllid cestodes, there is genital pore on the side of the proglottid.
Eggs are released when proglottid deteriorates, and so a uterine pore is unnecessary.

The MTHFR gene (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NAD(P)H)) is located on chromosome 1p36.3.
The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a co-substrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine.
Genetic variation in this gene influences susceptibility to occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, colon cancer and acute leukemia, and mutations in this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.
Two common variants in the MTHFR gene are c.665C>T (also known as c.677C>T, and p.Ala222Val) and c.1298A>C. The 665C>T variant is heat labile, and patients who are homozygous for this variant have higher serum levels of homocysteine and lower levels of folate.
Individuals who have one copy of each of the two variants have similar clinical manifestations, while those who are homozygous for 1298A>C do not have elevated homocysteine levels.

Borrelia burgdorferi is a Gram negative spirochete bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
It is most commonly transmitted to humans by an infected tick.
Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans that usually spreads from the bite mark.
If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system.
Paralysis of one or both sides of the face may occur.
Treatment often requires antibiotics.
This bacterium is microaerophillic and slow-growing, explaining the long delays when diagnosing Lyme disease.
There are a large number of sub-species which differ in clinical symptoms and presentation as well as geographic distribution.
The life-cycle of B. burgdorferi is complex, requiring ticks, rodents, and deer as temporary hosts.
Mice are the primary reservoir for the bacteria that are transmitted to deer by the tick Ixodes scapularis.

Pepsin is an enzyme whose precursor form (pepsinogen) is released by the chief cells in the stomach and that degrades food proteins into peptides.
Pepsin is a digestive protease.
Pepsin is one of three principal protein-degrading, or proteolytic, enzymes in the digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin.
The three enzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form.
During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining.
Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a purine salvage pathway enzyme, which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine into inosine and ammonia.
Elevated adenosine deaminase activities are found in tuberculous pleural and pericardial effusions.
In addition, increased ADA levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been observed in tuberculous meningitis.
These ADA increases are caused by the cellular immune response in the fluid compartment, especially in the activation of T lymphocytes.
Thus, many disorders can cause elevations.
Deficency of adenosine deaminase is the most frequent known cause of SCID (Severe combined immunodeficency disease) it is observed in 25% of cases.

A disadvantage of the test is that because EtG can be detected at very low levels, it can also be positive after exposure to alcohol from non-beverage sources such as mouthwash, foods, over-the-counter medications, or incidental exposure, which can lead to false positives.
Actin is a protein found in all eukaryotic cells.
It is the monomeric subunit of two types of filaments in cells: microfilaments and thin filaments.
There are three main groups of actin isoforms - alpha, beta, and gamma.
The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and contribute to muscle contraction.
The beta and gamma actins exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton and contribute to cell shape, motility and division.

Total iron-binding capacity is a test that measures the extent to which iron-binding sites in the serum can be saturated.
Because the iron-binding sites in the serum are almost entirely on circulating transferrin, this is really an indirect measurement of the amount of transferrin in the blood.
Along with with serum iron and percent transferrin saturation this test is performed when anemia or iron deficiency are suspected.
However, because the liver produces transferrin, liver function must also be considered when performing this test.
It can also be an indirect test of liver function, but is rarely used for this purpose.
The liver produces more transferrin in response to iron deficiency, so the percent transferrin saturation (i.e., the result of the formula of serum ironTIBC x 100) can also be a useful indicator.
Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is a neuropeptide of the bombesin family that elicits gastrin release from the stomach, regulates enteric motility, and is involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes.

The human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B;) plays an important role in how the immune system recognizes and responds to pathogens.
HLA-B belongs to a class of molecules that are found on the surface of most cells.
These molecules are responsible for presenting peptides to immune cells.
Peptides derived from normal human proteins are recognized as such, whereas foreign peptides derived from pathogens trigger an immune response.
Antiepileptics with an aromatic ring, for example carbamazepine and phenytoin, interact with HLA-B*15:02 and alter the repertoire of self-peptides that are presented to T lymphocytes, which activates an immune reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis..

7-Isobiopterin (also known as 7-biopterin or primapterin), is a pterin derivative of 4a-hydroxy-BH4.
In healthy patients, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is converted to 4a-hydroxy-BH4 with a concomitant conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and BH4 is subsequently regenerated via a pathway that includes pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD), which is encoded by the PCBD gene.
Mutations in the PCBD gene are associated with decreased PCD activity, which results in decreased BH4 salvage, increase in phenylalanine due to inhibition of the BH4 to 4a-hydroxy-BH4 reaction, and concomitant increase in 7-biopterin in urine due to alternate metabolism of 4a-hydroxy-BH4.
The influenza A and B virus genomes comprise eight segmented viral RNAs (vRNAs).
Each RNA segment encodes 1 or 2 nonstructural proteins.

O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is an essential enzyme involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents.
Hypermethylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA damage and prone to tumor development.
Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation.
In patients with malignant brain tumors, the loss of activity has been shown to be a promising predictor of response to alkylating agent-based chemotherapies, including BCNU (carmustine), CCNU and Temozolomide.
The loss of MGMT activity in tumor cells can no longer repair the methyl adduct formation caused by the chemotherapy, leading to lethal cross-links between DNA strands.
Most patients with methylated MGMT (m_MGMT) experience an increase in overall survival and time to progression of the disease.
The MGMT and Ã-Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio (score) of MGMT/Ã-Actin x 1000.

Scrapie is a fatal transmissible degenerative disease of the central nervous system occurring naturally in sheep and goats, and the prototype of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or prion diseases.
The name "Scrapie" was coined as infected animals usually scrape off their wool from itching and rubbing.
Although natural transmission of Scrapie to other species has not been shown, TSEs are the subject of increased attention and concern because of the discovery of BSE in cattle and the link between it and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
Genotyping determines the amino acids coded by five different codons (112, 136, 141, 154, 171) in the prion protein gene (PrP).
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
Though there are multiple genes expressing different levels of susceptibility, codon 171 is the gene most focused on in the U.S.
At this gene, "QQ" animals are highly susceptible to Scrapie infection if exposed, "QR" are rarely susceptible, and "RR" are highly resistant.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant breeding stock.
Speckled ANA pattern correlates with antibody to nuclear antigens extractable by saline; it is found in many disease states, including SLE and scleroderma.
When antibodies to DNA and deoxyribonucleoprotein are present (rim and homogenous pattern), there may be interference with the detection of speckled pattern.
American cheese is a common processed cheese.
It is orange, yellow, or white in color and mild in flavor, with a medium-firm consistency, and melts easily.
American cheese was originally only white, but can sometimes be modified to yellow in color.
It has traditionally been made from a blend of cheeses, most often Colby and Cheddar.
Today's American cheese is generally no longer made from a blend of all-natural cheeses, but instead is manufactured from a set of ingredients such as milk, whey, milkfat, milk protein concentrate, whey protein concentrate, and salt.
When substitutes are used it does not meet the legal definition of cheese in many jurisdictions, and must be labeled as "cheese product" or similar.

However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine.
3-Methylcrotonylglycine is a normal amino acid metabolite found in urine.
Increased levels of this metabolite are found in patients suffering from leucine catabolic disorders, such as 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency.

MART-1 / Melan-A is a protein antigen found on melanocytes.
Antibodies against the antigen are used in the medical specialty of anatomic pathology in order to recognize cells of melanocytic differentiation, useful for the diagnosis of a melanoma.
The same name is also used to refer to the gene which codes for the antigen.
The names MART-1 and Melan-A were coined by two groups of researchers who independently sequenced the gene for this antigen in 1994.
Both names are currently in common use.
at the National Cancer Institute coined the term MART-1, which stands for "Melanoma Antigen Recognized by T-cells.
Coulie et al. of Belgium called the gene Melan-A, presumably an abbreviation for "melanocyte antigen.
The MART-1 / Melan-A antigen is specific for the melanocyte lineage, found in normal skin, the retina, and melanocytes, but not in other normal tissues.
It is thus useful as a marker for melanocytic tumors (melanomas) with the caveat that it is normally found in benign nevi as well.
MART-1 / Melan-A is a putative 18 kDa transmembrane protein consisting of 118 amino acids.
It has a single transmembrane domain.
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is required for nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA and is homologous to RAD10.
In mammalian cells, XPG cleaves 3' of the DNA lesion while ERCC1-XPF complex makes the 5' incision.
In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), studies have shown that levels of expression of ERCC1 in tumors are indicative of treatment outcome for various types of chemotherapy.
The KCNQ2 gene (potassium channel, voltage gated KQT-like subfamily Q, member 2) is located on chromosome 20q13.3.
The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium channel that plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal excitability.
The M channel is formed by the association of the protein encoded by this gene and a related protein encoded by the KCNQ3 gene, both integral membrane proteins.
M channel currents are inhibited by M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activated by retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant drug.
Defects in this gene are a cause of benign familial neonatal convulsions type 1 (BFNC), also known as epilepsy, benign neonatal type 1 (EBN1).
At least five transcript variants encoding five different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Clostridium perfringens is a gram positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium.
It is classified into five types designated A through E. Four toxins are produced by C. perfringens that have lethal, necrotic and cytotoxic capabilities.
The four toxins are known as alpha-toxin (CPA), beta-toxin (CPB), epsilon-toxin (ETX) and iota-toxin (ITX).
When toxins produced by C. perfringens are mixed in different combination, sixteen toxins can be produced.
Pathogenesis due to C. perfringens is due almost always to the production of one or more of its toxins.
CPA is encoded by the cpa gene that is located on the chromosome and is produced by all strains of C. perfringens.
CPA is an enzyme that breaks down phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin which damages membrane phospholipids and leads to the lysis of cells.
CPA also cause hemolysis, activates the arachidonic cascade and inflammation cascade which induce vasoconstriction.
There is no definitive evidence that CPA is involved with enteritis, abomasitis and/or enterotoxemia in cattle, horses, goats, and pigs.
In humans, studies support that CPA is the main toxin believed to cause gas gangrene, a disease involving extensive local tissue damage and necrosis that leads to shock and death.
Gas gangrene also occurs in domestic animals including sheep, cattle, goats, and horses.
The RPGRIP1 gene (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1) is located on chromosome 14q11.

Calciferol or ergocalciferol, also known as Vit D2, is a fat-soluble prohormone.
Vitamin D has many functions including the regulation of calcium and phosphorus levels in blood, the promotion of bone formation and mineralization, and the boosting of the immune system.
Vitamin D deficiency may result from inadequate dietary intake, insufficient sunlight, malabsorption problems, kidney or liver impairment.
It occurs naturally in fish.
Vitamin D2 is produced when UVB radiation from sunlight reacts with ergosterol.
It is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol which in turn is hydroxylated in the kidney into two dihydroxylated metabolites which are 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the active hormone) and 24R,25 (OH)2D3.
The thrombin clotting time (TCT), also known as the thrombin time (TT), is a coagulation assay which is usually performed to detect the therapeutic level of the anticoagulant heparin.
It can also detect the presence of a fibrinogen abnormality.

Collagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total.
It is one of the long, fibrous structural proteins whose functions are quite different from those of globular proteins such as enzymes.
Strong, tough bundles of collagen called collagen fibers are a major component of the extracellular matrix that supports most tissues and gives cells structure from the outside, but collagen is also found inside certain cells.
Collagen has great tensile strength, and is the main component of cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bone and teeth.
Along with soft keratin, it is responsible for skin strength and elasticity, and its degradation leads to wrinkles that accompany aging.
It strengthens blood vessels and plays a role in tissue development.
It is present in the cornea and lens of the eye in crystalline form.
It is also used in cosmetic surgery and burns surgery.

A heavy metal is any of a number of higher atomic weight elements, which normally presents as a metallic substance at room temperatures.
There are several different definitions of which elements fall in this class designation:
According to one definition, heavy metals are a group of elements between copper and bismuth on the periodic table of the elementshaving specific gravities greater than 4.0.A stricter definition limits the term to those metals heavier than the rare earth metals, at the bottom of the periodic table.
None of these are essential elements in biological systems; all of the more well-known elements with the exception of bismuth and gold are toxic.
Thorium and uranium are sometimes included as well, but they are more often called simply radioactive metals.
Cortisol is excreted into the urine unbound, that is, as free cortisol.
In most cases this is the only form excreted and measured in the urine.
Urinary-free cortisol concentration closely approximates the unconjugated plasma cortisol concentration.
Whereas serum cortisol levels fluctuate throughout the day and are dependent on concurrent cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) levels, a 24-hour urine measurement integrates the cortisol production for the entire day and is not affected by CBG.
The greatest value of urinary free cortisol measurement is to detect states of adrenal hyperfunction such as Cushing's syndrome.

The MYD88 gene, located on chromosome 3, encodes the myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88.
Germline mutations in MYD88 are associated with a disorder called MyD88 deficiency, which is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections.
A specific somatic mutation in the MYD88 gene involving replacement of the amino acid leucine by proline at position 265 (Leu265Pro) is found in more than 90% of patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, a type of blood cancer associated with excessive production of IgM.
This same mutation is also found in more than half of patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM-MGUS) as well as some patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphoma.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma herpes virus also known as human herpes 4 and occurs only in humans.
EBV is prevalent worldwide with over 90% of the adult population infected in their lifetime.
The virus is spread mainly through body fluids and particularly through saliva.
Symptoms of infection include fatigue, fever, inflamed throat, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, enlarged spleen, swollen liver and rash.
EBV becomes dormant post infection but occasionally will reactivate especially in immunosuppressed patients.
Laboratory tests are used to determine whether the infection is a primary infection (absence of anti-EBNA, presence of anti-VCA) or a past infection (presence of both anti-EBNA and anti-VCA) Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen begins to appear 2-4 months after symptoms first are evident and persist for the life of the patient.

The CDKN2B gene (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15, inhibits CDK4)) is located on chromosome 9p21.
This gene lies adjacent to the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A in a region that is frequently mutated and deleted in a wide variety of tumors.
This gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6, and prevents the activation of the CDK kinases, thus the encoded protein functions as a cell growth regulator that controls cell cycle G1 progression.
The expression of this gene was found to be dramatically induced by TGF beta, which suggested its role in the TGF beta induced growth inhibition.
Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported.
Campylobacter (meaning 'twisted bacteria') is a genus of bacteria that are Gram-negative, spiral, and microaerophilic.
Motile, with either uni- or bi-polar flagella, the organisms have a characteristic spiral/corkscrew appearance and are oxidase-positive.
Campylobacter jejuni is now recognized as one of the main causes of bacterial foodborne disease in many developed countries.
At least a dozen species of Campylobacter have been implicated in human disease, with C. jejuni and C. coli the most common.
C. fetus causes spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep, and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans.
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is one of three protein hormones that share structural similarity to insulin.
The major role of IGF-2 is as a growth promoting hormone during gestation.
IGF-2 exerts its effects by binding to the IGF-1 receptor.
IGF2 may also bind to the IGF-2 receptor (also called the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor), which acts to prevent IGF2 responses.
IGF-2 has also been shown to interact with IGFBP3 and transferrin.
IGF-2 is sometimes produced in excess in islet cell tumors, causing hypoglycemia.
Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome in which hypoglycemia is associated with the presence of one or more non-islet fibrous tumors in the pleural cavity.
Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is a common feature in tumors seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
As IGF2 promotes development of fetal pancreatic beta cells, it is believed to be related to some forms of diabetes mellitus.

In addition, men with the GG genotype at this location are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
A triple bolus test or a dynamic pituitary function test is a medical diagnostic procedure used to assess a patient's pituitary function.
Three hormones (usually synthetic analogues) are injected as a bolus into the patient's vein to stimulate the anterior pituitary gland: insulin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).
The gland's response is assessed by measuring cortisol, growth hormone (GH), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) hormone levels.
Blood glucose levels are also monitored for hypoglycemia.
A triple bolus test is usually ordered and interpreted by endocrinologists.

It is carried by Glossina pallidipes, G. morsitans and occasionally other species of game-attacking tsetse flies.
In immunology, the CD3 antigen (CD stands for cluster of differentiation) is a protein complex composed of four distinct chains (CD3Î³, CD3Î´ and two times CD3Îµ) in mammals, that associate with molecules known as the T cell receptor (TCR) and the Î¶-chain to generate an activation signal in T lymphocytes.
Pancreatic stone protein (PSP), also known as lithostathine-1-alpha, is a protein mainly secreted by the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas.
It is associated with islet cell regeneration and may be involved in pancreatic lithogenesis.
Low levels of PSP are found in healthy individuals, but PSP concentration increases with severe infection and organ dysfunction.
The measurement of PSP levels help identify patients with sepsis or those who are at risk of developing sepsis.
PSP also aids in discriminating non-infectious and infection-related inflammation.
Cells expressing CD45 (CD45+) in the absence of CD3 (CD3-) are used as an initial gating population for identifying natural killer (NK) cells.
In addition to CD3-, a majority of NK cells are further gated on the expression of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule) and CD16 (low-affinity IgG Fc receptor-FcgammaRIII) cell surface markers.
However, NK cells are not a homogeneous population since not all NK cells express the CD56 and CD16 markers uniformly.
NK cells that express CD56+ and are CD16- are called regulatory or cytokine secreting NK cells, whereas NK cells that express CD16+ and are CD56+/- (dim or negative) are referred to as cytotoxic NK cells.
NK cell deficiencies may be present in various primary (monogenic) immunodeficiencies (e.g.autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiencies) or in isolated NK cell deficiency (e.g. absolute NK cell deficiency (ANKD), the classic NK cell deficiency (CNKD), and the functional NK cell deficiency (FNKD)).
T cell and B cell crossmatching assesses recipient antibodies against organ donor HLA and other antigens.
T cell and B cell crossmatching results may be reported separately or combined to report the overall interpretation.
For example, if T cell crossmatch results are positive and B cell crossmatch results are positive, the overall interpretation is positive.
If one result is negative and the other is positive, the overall interpretation is undetermined and further investigation is needed.

The F11 (coagulation factor XI) gene is located on chromosome region 4q35.
This gene encodes coagulation factor XI of the blood coagulation cascade.
This protein is present in plasma as a zymogen, which is a unique plasma coagulation enzyme because it exists as a homodimer consisting of two identical polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds.
During activation of the plasma factor XI, an internal peptide bond is cleaved by factor XIIa (or XII) in each of the two chains, resulting in activated factor XIa, a serine protease composed of two heavy and two light chains held together by disulfide bonds.
This activated plasma factor XI triggers the middle phase of the intrisic pathway of blood coagulation by activating factor IX.
Defects in this factor lead to Rosenthal syndrome, a blood coagulation abnormality.
The standard thickness parameter is used as part of the calculation for corrected or compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc).
Thinner corneas may result in underestimated IOPs with tonometry measures, while eyes with thicker corneas may have overestimated IOP values.

A Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) is a blood cell having a round nucleus, such as a lymphocyte or a monocyte.
These blood cells are a critical component in the immune system to fight infection and adapt to intruders.
The lymphocyte population consists of T cells (CD4 and CD8 positive ~75%), B cells and NK cells (~25% combined).
These cells are often extracted from whole blood using ficoll, a hydrophilic polysaccharide that separates layers of blood, with monocytes and lymphocytes forming a buffy coat under a layer of plasma.
This buffy coat contains the PBMCs.
Additionally, PBMC can be extracted from whole blood using a hypotonic lysis which will preferentially lyse red blood cells.
This method results in neutrophils and other polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells which are important in innate immune defense to be obtained.
PBMCs are widely used in research and clinical uses every day.
HIV research uses them because PBMCs include CD4+ cells, the cells HIV infects.
Disease-producing bacteria are known to make more deoxyribonuclease (DNase) than benign microbes.

Pneumocystis jiroveci is a fungus.
This parasitic organism was earlier classified as a protozoan, and still is sometimes called by its former name Pneumocystis carinii.
It causes the disease pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), which afflicts people with weakened immune systems, such as children, the elderly, and especially AIDS patients, in whom it is most commonly observed today.
It was first recognized in institutional epidemics among malnourished children and infants.
The actual life cycle is unknown.
Debate continues as to whether or not the parasite is transmitted through latent infection or active infection.
Historically it was thought to be latent, with a duration of up to a year, but recent studies suggest an active state.
Symptoms of infection include shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and low grade fever.
Death by asphyxia is a consequent threat, as in any pneumonia.
Proteoglycan 2, bone marrow (natural killer cell activator, eosinophil granule major basic protein), also known as PRG2, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the PRG2 gene.

Tritrichomonas foetus is a single celled flagellated protozoan parasite that is known to be a pathogen of the bovine reproductive tract as well as the intestinal tract of cats.
In cattle, the organism is transmitted to the female vagina and uterus from the foreskin of the bull where the parasite is known to reside.
It causes infertility, and, at times, has caused spontaneous abortions in the first trimester.
Cases of infection in cattle have declined due to the use of artificial insemination.
In the last ten years, there have been reports of Tritrichomonas foetus in the feces of young cats that have diarrhea and live in households with multiple cats.
Description Tritrichomonas foetus belongs to the order Trichomonadida in the Kingdom Protoctista.

Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amebae that can infect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause life-threatening disease.
The route of entry and clinical course of infection varies with the type of ameba involved.
N. fowleri live in warm, stagnant fresh water lakes and nonsterile water.
The amebae is acquired by entering through the nasal sinuses, traveling along the olfactory nerve through the skull and into the central nervous system (CNS).
N. fowleri causes rapidly progressive primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) and is typically fatal within several days of exposure.
Most diagnoses are made after death due to the rarity of the condition.
The fractional excretion of phosphate is a measure of the percentage of phosphate excreted in the urine versus the phosphate reabsorbed by the kidney.
The presence of SLA antibodies has almost 100% specificity for autoimmune hepatitis, although only 12-30% have these antibodies.
Thus, a negative SLA IgG test does not rule out autoimmune hepatitis.
HIV infection decreases the number of CD4 T-cells, also called T4 helper cells, the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T-cells and the number of CD8+ T-cells.
These counts are ordered frequently to guide decisions about anti-retroviral therapy.
Laboratories usually report both percentage and absolute count.
When you map CD4 and CD8 markers, be careful!
Since at least 1997, CDC has required the detection of both CD3+ and CD4+ to identify T4 helper cells, because the CD3 marker is needed to identify T-cell.
So, any tests that report T4 helper cells are really reporting cells that carry BOTH the CD3+ and the CD4+ markers.
The measure name may be CD3+ CD4+ cells, CD4+ marker, T4 cells or even just CD4+ (a misnomer).
Exactly analogous rules apply to CD8+.
Measures that include only CD4 or only CD8 in their name are really measuring CD3+CD4+ cells or CD3+CD8+ cells, respectively and should be reported with the LOINC code that includes both of those markers.
The panel named T cell subsets will usually contain both CD3 + CD4 and CD3 + CD8 counts.
These names assume that one has already gated to lymphocytes only.
Lymphocytes are identified by CD45 markers.
So a CD45+CD3+CD4+ is a more complicated way to name CD3+C4+ cells and in the context of looking for CD4 helper T cells they are the same.
The same applies to other flow cytometer measures that are looking only at lymphocytes (B-cells, NK cells, etc).
CD40 is a costimulatory protein found on antigen presenting cells and is required for their activation.
The binding of CD154 (CD40L) on TH cells to CD40 activates antigen presenting cells and induces a variety of downstream effects.
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily.
This receptor has been found to be essential in mediating a broad variety of immune and inflammatory responses including T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching, memory B cell development, and germinal center formation.
AT-hook transcription factor AKNA is reported to coordinately regulate the expression of this receptor and its ligand, which may be important for homotypic cell interactions.
Adaptor protein TNFR2 interacts with this receptor and serves as a mediator of the signal transduction.
The interaction of this receptor and its ligand is found to be necessary for amyloid-beta-induced microglial activation, and thus is thought to be an early event in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.
Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.
The appearance of abnormally long or short microsatellites in an individual's DNA is referred to as microsatellite instability.
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition manifested by damaged DNA due to defects in the normal DNA repair process.

Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
The IDUA gene, located on chromosome 4p16.3, encodes alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes the terminal alpha-L-iduronic acid residues of two glycosaminoglycans, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.
Mutations in the IDUA gene lead to alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency, which is associated with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPSI).
MPSI has 3 forms: IH (Hurler syndrome), IH/S (Hurler-Scheie syndrome), and IS (Scheie syndrome).
Hurler syndrome is the most severe form of MPSI, is usually diagnosed in the first year of life, and is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, corneal clouding, and severe cognitive delay.
Patients with Hurler syndrome typically die before the age of 10.
In contrast, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes are usually diagnosed later in childhood or adulthood and have little, if any, cognitive delay.
Reticulocyte distribution width (RDWr) is a measure of the variability in reticulocyte volume.
Along with other reticulocyte indices, RDWr can be used to monitor treatment efficacy for certain types of anemia, such as magnesium therapy in sickle cell disease.
RDWr is analogous to red cell distribution width (RDW), and RDWr and RDW tend to have similar values.
Chromosome region 4q12 rearrangements are associated with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms due to disruption of the PDGFRA and/or FGFR1 genes.
Patients with rearrangement(s) involving PDGFRA most commonly present with chronic eosinophilic leukemia but also can present as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and/or T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL).
Patients with FGFR1 involvement have various presentations including AML, T- or B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL), or a mixed phenotype acute leukemia.
Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is the first-line therapy for patients with abnormalities of PDGFRA, whereas patients with FGFR1 fusions are resistant to this therapy and carry a poor prognosis.

Glutamine's associated disorders are urea cycle defects and it may be elevated in urine in citullinemia, Hartnup disease, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
APOB and LDLR are the most common genes associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
APOB encodes apolipoprotein B, a primary protein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons.
Mutations in the APOB gene affect the region of apolipoprotein B that binds to the LDL receptor, which results in decreased receptor binding, leading to increased circulating levels of LDL.
LDLR encodes the LDL cell membrane receptor, which binds LDL and transports it into the cell.
LDLR mutations result in defective binding of LDL to the LDL receptor, resulting in increased circulating levels of LDL.

Chlamydia are gram-negative and produce glycogen.
The H antigen is produced by a specific fucosyltransferase.
Depending upon a person's ABO blood type, the H antigen is converted into either the A antigen, B antigen, or both.
If a person has blood group O, the H antigen remains unmodified.
Therefore, the H antigen is present in the highest amounts in blood type O and in the least amounts in blood type AB.
The history and biochemical nature of the H antigen is entangled with that of the ABO and Lewis blood group systems.
The recognition of the Hh blood group probably begins with the discovery by Bhende et al. (1952) of the first three individuals who completely lacked A and B antigens but were not group O.
This null phenotype was named "Bombay" after the city where it was found.
Although the Bombay phenotype is extremely rare in most populations, a number of examples have been found in India over the years.
Early suggestions were that this type was due to a new allele at the ABO locus, but others suggested an inhibitor gene and finally the possibility of a genetically independent but related gene.
We now know that the Bombay phenotype is due to a recessive gene at the H locus; ie. h and is therefore referred to as Oh.
Subsequently, intermediate form of the H gene have been found and these individuals are called "para-Bombays".
Conjugated protein-carbohydrate compounds including mucins, mucoid, and amyloid glycoproteins.
Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus endemic to northern Australia and New Guinea and is the causal agent of Murray Valley encephalitis.
MVEV is related to West Nile virus Kunjin strain but is more virulent for humans compared to West Nile Kunjin.
The majority of MVEV infections are asymptomatic or cause a non-specific febrile illness that may be associated with headache, myalgias and rash, but approximately 1 out of 150 to 1000 MVEV infections result in clinical encephalitis.
The incubation period is one to four weeks, and patients with encephalitis usually present with fever, headache, malaise, and altered mental status.
Complications include progressive neurological deterioration, parkinsonian tremor, cranial nerve palsies, peripheral neuropathy, coma, and flaccid paralysis.
The reported case fatality rate of human MVEV encephalis is between 15-30%.
Laboratory confirmation of a suspected MVEV infection requires either the isolation of the virus itself, detection of MVEV RNA, a fourfold rise in the IgG titer between acute and convalescent serum samples, or detection of IgM in serum or CSF (in the absence of cross-reactive antibodies).
Indicates whether a patient's emergency department (ED) visit is an initial or follow-visit.
An ED episode of care begins with the initial visit for care for a particular problem and ends when the patient is no longer continuing treatment.
A subsequent visit for the problem is considered a follow-up ED episode of care.
An initial visit may be diagnostic in nature whereas a follow-up visit may be to check progress or continue therapy.

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by either a qualitative or quantitative deficit of the multimeric glycoprotein known as von Willebrand factor (VWF).
VWD affects 1-2% of the world population, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis by triggering platelet adhesion to injured vessel walls and promoting platelet aggregation.
VWF also protects factor VIII from premature degradation in the peripheral circulation.
To diagnose VWD, there are several tests that must be run including ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen quantitative assay, Factor VIII activity, and collagen binding assay.
Additional tests are needed to determine the subtype of VWD.
The ristocetin cofactor activity can be measured using platelet aggregation or platelet agglutination.
Both of these assays measure the agglutination of platelets by VWF in the presence of ristocetin.
When anti-VWF antibodies bind to the epitope of VWF the ability of VWF to aggregate platelets to the area of injury is compromised.
Patients who are most likely to develop anti-VWF include patients with complete or partial VWF gene deletions, patients who have received multiple transfusions, and patients with a family history of developing anti-VWF antibodies.

Adenoviruses, medium-sized (90-100 nm), non-enveloped icosohedral viruses with double-stranded DNA, have over 50 immunologically distinct types that cause infections in humans.
Adenoviruses usually cause respiratory illness with symptoms ranging from the common cold to pneumonia, croup, and bronchitis.
Adenoviruses can cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and less commonly, neurological disease.
Infants and individuals with weakened immune systems are at high risk for severe complications of adenovirus infection and adenoviruses commonly cause acute respiratory illness in military recruits.
Some asymptomatic people infected with adenoviruses have ongoing infections in their tonsils, adenoids, and intestines and can shed the virus for months or years.
The virus can persist outside the body for long periods.
Adenovirus infections can be detected using antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction assay, virus isolation, and serology.
Typing is usually done by hemagglutination-inhibition and/or neutralization with type-specific antisera or by molecular methods.
As of October 2014 there is no adenovirus vaccine for the general public, however an oral vaccine against types 4 and 7 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2011 for U.S. military personnel.
The vaccine is recommended by the U.S. Department of Defense for military recruits entering basic training in order to prevent acute respiratory disease.
Most adenovirus infections are mild and typically require only treatment of symptoms.
There are seven subgroups or species of adenovirus labeled A through G.
The subgroups of adenovirus infect certain areas of the body.
Subgroups A and F are usually found in the gastrointestinal tract.
Subgroups B, C and E tend to infect the respiratory tract.
Subgroup D is the cause of epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis.
Subgroup G causes gastroenteritis.
The DNA homology between the subgroups is less than 20%.

When discussing visual acuity, such as 20/40, the numerator is the testing distance.
In the US, 20 is measured in feet.
In the metric system, the testing distance is measured in meters.
Normal visual acuity is commonly referred to as 20/20 vision and the metric equivalent is 6/6 vision.
The denominator is also a distance - the distance at which the size of the tested letter would subtend an arc of 5 minutes; what changes is the size of the letters and the distance at which the letters subtend that 5 minutes of angle.
A letter of the size on the 20/40 line of an eye chart would be able to be seen by a patient with normal (20/20) vision at a testing distance of 40 feet, but for a patient with reduced vision (e.g. 20/40) the letter would need to be moved closer (to 20 feet) in order to be seen.
When reading an eyechart in an ophthalmology exam room, mirrors are used to simulate a 20 foot testing distance (as the room is typically much shorter than 20 feet in length).
Visual acuity is expressed as 20/20, 20/40 up to about 20/800.
Vision worse than that is often expressed qualitatively as: CF- Count Fingers HM- Hand Motion LP- Light Perception NLP- No Light Perception

Veterinary medicine: Mycoplasma suis is an organism that lacks a cell wall and is unable to be cultured in vitro.
It is the causative agent of porcine eperythrozoonosis or infectious anemia.
It attaches to the red blood cells of pigs by adhesion, then invades them, forages nutrients, causes immune-mediated lysis, and finally induces eryptosis, or suicidal death of the cell.
Infection of M suis can be devastating to pig growers and cause huge economic loss.
M suis infections occur worldwide and cause acute or chronic hemolytic anemia, growth retardation in feeder pigs, and poor reproduction in sows.
M suis is suspected to be transmitted by mosquitoes, biting flies, and the hog louse.
Other modes of transmission include contaminated surgical instruments such as castration knives, and needles used repeatedly during vaccination.
Because M suis cannot be cultured in vitro, there is little knowledge of its biology and pathogenicity.
The NAGLU gene (N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase) is located on chromosome 17q21.2.
This gene encodes an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate by hydrolysis of terminal N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminides.
Defects in this gene are the cause of mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS-IIIB), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome B.
This disease is characterized by the lysosomal accumulation and urinary excretion of heparan sulfate.
Pentachlorophenol (C6 HCl5 O) is a synthetic fungicide which is an organochloride.
It is toxic to humans.
Pentachlorophenol has historically been used as a pesticide and wood preservative.
In 1984 (or 1987 references vary), the purchase and use of pentachlorophenol was restricted in the United States, and the general public may no longer buy it.
It still has some industrial use as a wood preservative for utility poles, railroad ties, and wharf pilings.
Exposures to pentachlorophenol measured in minute quantities has been shown to affect the endocrine system of vertebrate life forms and may lead to immune system disfunction, and disruption of normal sexual, cognitive, physical and emotional development.
It has also been linked to trans-generational cancer through disruption of foetal development.
Its main action on the cell is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and therefore deplete levels of cellular ATP.

Reports in the literature have not differentiated which of the three is predominantly responsible for adverse symptoms, and as with other mammalian allergens, the assumption is reasonable that all three contribute.
One study reports on occupational asthma that was caused by allergy to Pigs' urine.
This testing provides genotypes for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and determines the estimated metabolic activity.
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the hepatic metabolism of up to 50% of all clinically used drugs.
There is wide variation in enzyme activity, particularly for CYP3A4 (10-100 fold), due to both genetic and non-genetic factors.
The cause of much of the variation is not yet understood.
The CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes have a high degree of similarity (85% amino acid sequence homology) and they metabolism largely the same set of drugs, Though many use the CYP3A4 pathway predominantly.
Genotype and metabolic activity for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 should therefore be considered together when assessing possible effects on drug response.
*22 decreases enzyme activity, and is present in ~8% of Caucasians.
CYP3A5 *3 is a non-functional allele, so CYPA5 *3/*3 homozygotes are non-expressors of CYP3A5.
CYP3A5 *3 is the predominant CYP3A5 allele in Caucasians (prevalence of ~92%) and therefore most Caucasians have reduced or absent CYP3A5 metabolism.
CYP3A5 *6 and *7 lead to decreased enzyme activity.
CYP3A5 *6 and *7 are present in 11-12% of Asians and African Americans, but are essentially absent in Caucasians (frequency of 0.1%).
CYP3A4 *22 is typically associated with increased response to statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin), with lower doses required to gain optimal response.
For CYP3A5, poor metabolizers are typically expected to require standard dosing of tacrolimus.
Intermediate or extensive metabolizers are expected to require a higher starting dose of tacrolimus.
Fentanyl is a key pain medication that is metabolized by CYP3A4/3A5.
The CYP3A5 *3 variant has decreased clearance of this active drug.
Patients with the CYP3A5 *3/*3 genotype have a higher risk of adverse events than patients with one or two *1 alleles.
However, CYP3A genotype and clinical variables (delivery rate, gender, co-medications, kidney disease, BMI and serum albumin) account for less than 50% of the wide variability in serum fentanyl concentration between patients with transdermal fentanyl treatment.
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of approximately 40 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function.
Lysosomal storage diseases result when a specific organelle in the body's cells - the lysosome - malfunctions.
Tay-Sachs disease was the first of these disorders to be described, followed by Gaucher disease.
Lysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids, glycoproteins (sugar containing proteins) or so-called mucopolysaccharides.
Individually, LSDs occur with incidences of less than 1:100.000, however, as a group the incidence is about 1:5000 - 1:10.000.
Most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited, however a few are X-linked recessively inherited, such as Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome (MPS II).
Quinine is a natural white crystalline alkaloid having antipyretic, anti-malarial with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties and a bitter taste.
It is a stereoisomer of quinidine.
Quinine was previously superseded by chloroquine, but is now again the drug of choice for treatment of falciparum malaria because of the rise of chloroquine resistance.
Quinine is available with a prescription in the U.S. Quinine is also used to treat nocturnal leg cramps and arthritis and it has also been used (with limited success) to treat people who had been infected by prions.
It was once a popular heroin adulterant.
Anaylsis of metabolic end products (acylcarnitines)
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by either a qualitative or quantitative deficit of the multimeric glycoprotein known as von Willebrand factor (VWF).
VWD affects 1-2% of the world population, making it the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
VWF plays a crucial role in primary hemostasis by triggering platelet adhesion to injured vessel walls and promoting platelet aggregation.
VWF also protects factor VIII from premature degradation in the peripheral circulation.
To diagnose VWD, there are several tests that must be run including Ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF antigen quantitative assay, Factor VIII activity, and collagen binding assay.
Additional tests are needed to determine the subtype of VWD.
The collagen binding assay measures the ability of VWF to bind to collagen by combining patient plasma with collagen that is adhered to a matrix.
Then anti-VWF and dye are added in order to measure how much patient VWF combined to the collagen.
When an antibody binds with an epitope on the VFW that is meant to bind to collagen, the ability of VWF to function is compromised.
The collagen binding assay evaluates the functionality of the VWF, and is reduced in the presence of inhibiting anti-VWF antibodies.
Patients who are most likely to develop anti-VWF include patients with complete or partial VWF gene deletions, patients who have received multiple transfusions, and patients with a family history of developing anti-VWF antibodies.

Epithelial cells cover the inside and outside of almost all of the body's surfaces.
Squamous epithelial cells are flattened and barely visible by light microscopy.
They fit closely together in tissues; providing a smooth, low-friction surface over which fluids can move easily.
Squamous epithelia are found lining surfaces such as the alveolar epithelium in the lungs.
Specialized squamous epithelia also form the lining of cavities such as the blood vessels (endothelium) and pericardium (mesothelium) and the major cavities found within the body.
Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ alpha 1, also known as HLA-DQA1, is a human gene.
The protein encoded by this gene is one of two proteins that are required to form the DQ heterodimer, a cell surface receptor impportant for presenting antigens and triggering a humural immunity.
The gene is highly polymorphic (as are other HLA genes), and allele type can correlate with various diseases (such as celiac).
Antibodies formed in a transplant recipient to donor alleles can contribute to prediction of graft rejection.

B little g super little b antigens are members of the HLA Class I antigens and represent HLA-B17 (B57 or B58).
The B little g antigen group is designated as Bennett-Goodspeed antigens and are expressed on mature red blood cells (RBCs) and, like other HLA Class I antigens, are also expressed on platelets and the majority of nucleated cells.
In some patients, the Bg antigens are not expressed on the RBCs even though they are expressed on other cells.
Hemolytic transfusion reactions have rarely been attributed to Bg antibodies.
In addition, red cell survival has not been affected by Bg antibodies when patients receive HLA incompatible components.(AABB Technical Manual, 18th edition, pp 362, 480, 490)
The SDHD gene (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D, integral membrane protein) is located on chromosome 11q23.
This gene encodes a member of complex II of the respiratory chain, which is responsible for the oxidation of succinate.
The encoded protein is one of two integral membrane proteins anchoring the complex to the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane.
Mutations in this gene are associated with the formation of tumors, including hereditary paraganglioma.
Transmission of disease occurs almost exclusively through the paternal allele, suggesting that this locus may be maternally imprinted.
There are pseudogenes for this gene on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 18.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) is a sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in the therians (placental mammals and marsupials).
This intronless gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the high mobility group (HMG)-box family of DNA-binding proteins.
This protein is the testis determining factor (TDF), also referred to as the SRY protein, which initiates male sex determination.
Mutations in this gene give rise to XY females with gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome); translocation of part of the Y chromosome containing this gene to the X chromosome causes XX male syndrome.
Antibodies to Coccidioides TP antigen usually appear during the first week of infection, and remain detectable for approximately 5 months.

Aneuploidy is an abnormal number of chromosomes, and is a type of chromosome abnormality.
An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of genetic disorders (birth defects).
Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes.
Aneuploidy occurs during cell division when the chromosomes don't separate properly between the two cells.
Chromosome abnormalities occur in 1 of 160 live births, the most common being extra chromosomes 21, 18 and 13.
Measured from the intersection of the posterior border on the tongue and the inferior border of the mandible to the closest point on the posterior pharyngeal wall
Landsteiner and Wiener used blood from a monkey (Macacus rhesus) to immunize rabbits and guinea pigs in order to define new antibody specificities.
One of the antibodies they produced appeared to have the same specificity as a human antibody found in several woman who had stillborn fetuses.
Consequently, the antibodies were named anti-Rh for rhesus.
However, as early as 1942 it was known that the rabbit/guinea pig and human antibodies could not be the same.
When the guinea pig antibody was used to test Rh+ and Rh negative cord blood cells (as defined by the human antibody) all samples were reactive.
The guinea pig antibody was given the name "D-like".
Then Race and Sanger found two women whose antibodies could be absorbed by Rh negative red cells and which appeared to be similar to the "D-like" antibody from animals.
Following further studies by Levine the "D-like" name was changed to LW in honor of Landsteiner and Wiener.
Phl p 5 is a major allergen from Timothy grass pollen and is one of the most reactive of the group 5 allergens, inducing allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma in grass pollen-allergic patients.
Alpha (A) galactosidase is an enzyme used in sphingolipid metabolism.
The deficiency of the enzyme leads to accumulation of various products that may lead to Fabry's disease, which is lysosomal storage disorder.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone collectively are called ketone bodies.
The first two are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, in the mitochondria of liver cells; acetone is formed by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate.
Ketone body synthesis in liver is effectively irreversible because the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA is not present in liver cells.
Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids and triglycerides, are water-soluble.
They are exported from the liver, and are taken up by other tissues, notably brain and skeletal and cardiac muscle.
There, they are broken down to acetyl-CoA which is oxidized via the TCA cycle to yield energy.
In healthy individuals, this pathway of ketone body synthesis and utilization is most active during extended periods of fasting.
The tubular cells seen in casts are usually from the collecting tubes, but cells originating from the proximal tubules or any other sections (prior to the collecting tubes) of the nephron is possible.
With the PAP stain, Schumann subdivides renal tubular cell casts in RTC and necrotic RTC casts.
A few hyaline RTC casts or RTC casts can occasionally be found in a healthy person's urinary sediment.
In this context, these casts have no more clinical meanings than the hyaline casts.
The renal tubular cell casts are not associated with a precise pathology, but are found in multiple conditions that affect the renal tubules.
The RTC casts are non specific.
Pathologies associated with the presence of these casts include acute interstitial nephritis, acute transplant rejection, and tubular necrosis.
Necrotic RTC casts are seen in acute tubular necrosis and in nephrotoxic tubular diseases.
The typical renal tubular cell casts are described as hyaline matrix casts, showing two rows of well delimited tubular cells.
The two rows criteria is not reliable because the white blood cell casts can also appear with this particularity.
Sequestrated tubular cells in a hyaline matrix is possible, but recent studies indicate that the majority of casts of this type are composed of cells fixed to the surface of the casts.
Thyroid's secretory capacity, also referred to as thyroid output or thyroid capacity provides an estimate for the maximum secretion rate of the thyroid gland under stimulated conditions.
Thyroid secrectory capacity is elevated in hyperthyroidism and reduced in hypothyroidism.

Methionine is an essential nonpolar amino acid, and a lipotropic.
Methionine and cysteine are the only sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids.
The methionine derivative S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) serves as a methyl donor.
Methionine plays a role in cysteine, carnitine and taurine synthesis by the transsulfuration pathway, lecithin production, the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids.
Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis.
Methionine, a chelating agent, is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other).
The codon AUG is also significant, in that it carries the Start message for a ribosome to begin protein translation from mRNA.
As a consequence, methionine is incorporated into the N-terminal position of all proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it is usually removed by post-translational modification.
Similar to thrombin time except that a snake venom instead of thrombin.
Currently (2010), four standardization protocols exist for measuring Hgb A1c: 1. IFCC - designated as a Reference Method or RM suggests the use of alternate measures, such as glycated albumen, for patients with severe iron deficiency, dialysis patients, and those with SS SC CC because of over or under reading that can occur with these interferences.
It also describes the effect of abnormal hemoglobins on results of HbA1c by instrument.
Studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between glucose levels and hemoglobin A1C, and it has been suggested that some descendants of sub-Saharan Africa may have higher levels of measured hemoglobin A1C compared to glucose levels due to hemoglobin variants .
A water-soluble, enzyme co-factor present in minute amounts in every living cell.
It occurs mainly bound to proteins or polypeptides and is abundant in liver, kidney, pancreas, yeast, and milk.
Lorazepam glucuronide is a major metabolite of lorazepam, a high-potency, intermediate-duration, 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine drug, often used to treat anxiety disorders.
Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine.
Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable central nervous system (CNS) activity in animals.
On discontinuation, lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week.
Lorazepam-glucuronide is more water-soluble than its precursor, so gets more widely distributed in the body, leading to a longer half-life than lorazepam.
Lorazepam-glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys and, because of its tissue accumulation, remains detectable, particularly in the urine, for substantially longer than lorazepam.
A nonapeptide messenger that is enzymatically produced from KALLIDIN in the blood where it is a potent but short-lived agent of arteriolar dilation and increased capillary permeability.

Chlorpyrifos is an amber to white crystalline broad spectrum organophosphate and cholinesterase inhibitor.
It was originally developed to kill the larval stage of mosquitoes, but is now used to treat cutworms, corn rootworms, cockroaches, grubs, flea beetles, flies, termites, fire ants, and lice found on crops such as cotton, fruit, nuts, vegetables, as well as lawns and ornamental plants.
Chlorpyrifos can also be applied directly on sheep, turkeys, in dog kennels, domestic dwellings, farm buildings, and storage bins.
It is moderately poisonous to humans causing skin and eye irritation.
If chlorpyrifos is absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested, systemic intoxication from the inhibition of cholinesterase activity has been known to occur.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that chlorpyrifos does not affect human reproduction, is not teratogenic, is not mutagenic, and is not carcinogenic.
Chlorpyrifos is toxic to birds, freshwater fish, aquatic invertebrates, and estuarine and marine organisms.
Chlorpyrifos can be extremely toxic to wildlife and honeybees.
Species of American house dust mite, in the family pyroglyphidae
The IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, cytosolic) gene is located on chromosome 2 at 2q34.
The IDH1 gene encodes the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 enzyme, which is primarily found in cytoplasm of cells as well as in peroxisomes.
Mutations in the IDH1 gene are associated with various conditions, including Maffucci syndrome, Ollier disease, cholangiocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, gliomas, and chondrosarcomas.

The AHCY gene (adenosylhomocysteinase) is located on chromosome 20q11.22.
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase belongs to the adenosylhomocysteinase family.
It catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to adenosine (Ado) and L-homocysteine (Hcy).
Thus, it regulates the intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) concentration thought to be important for transmethylation reactions.
Deficiency in this protein is one of the different causes of hypermethioninemia.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
The Douglas fir is a tall evergreen timber tree, with short needles and egg-shaped cones similar to those of a Fir tree, but it is not a true Fir.
Douglas fir attains a height of 30 to 90 m.
The trees have irregularly whorled branches.
The foliage is feathery-soft and not sharp.
color varies from silver to heavy bluish-green.
Branchlets are nearly smooth, but not as smooth as the branches of Firs.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, similar to reactions caused by other members of this family, are possible following exposure to pollen from this tree; however, few specific studies have been reported to date.
Shiga toxins are a family of related toxins with two major groups, Stx1 and Stx2, expressed by genes considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages.
True Shiga toxin (Stx) is produced by Shigella dysenteriae.
(Shiga-like toxins 1 and 2 (SLT-1 and 2 or Stx-1 and 2) are the Shiga toxins produced by some E. coli strains.)
Î²-Glucans (or beta-glucans) are polysaccharides occurring in the bran of cereal grains, the cell wall of baker's yeast, certain types of fungi, and many kinds of mushrooms.
The cereal based beta-glucans occur most abundantly in barley and oats and to a much lesser degree in rye and wheat.
They are useful in human nutrition as texturing agents and as soluble fiber supplements, but problematic in the process of brewing.
An insoluble (1,3/1,6) beta glucan derived from baker's yeast has a different molecular structure than that of its soluble (1,3/1,4) counterparts and has a greater biological activity due to its structural "branching".
Yeast derived beta glucans are notable for their immunomodulatory function.
The differences between soluble and insoluble beta glucans are significant in regards to application, mode of action, and overall biological activity.
The measurement of alpha hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity has been used as cardiac specific marker in various ways over time (including perioperatively) to detect myocardial infarction, either alone or in combination with CK-MB.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum has 5 isoenzymes, those with faster electrophoretic mobility having a higher proportion of the H-subunit prevalent in cardiac tissue.
The faster cardiac LDH isoforms (e.g. LDH1) also have a greater catalytic activity to reduce alpha ketobutyrate known as "alpha hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity".

The C9orf72 gene (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) is located on chromosome 9p21.2.
The protein encoded by this gene plays an important role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking, and has been shown to interact with Rab proteins that are involved in autophagy and endocytic transport.
Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in non-coding sequence between alternate 5' exons in transcripts from this gene is associated with 9p-linked ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD (frontotemporal dementia).
Studies suggest that hexanucleotide expansions could result in the selective stabilization of repeat-containing pre-mRNA, and the accumulation of insoluble dipeptide repeat protein aggregates that could be pathogenic in FTD-ALS patients.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
Phytanic acid (or 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid) is present in human diet or in animal tissues where it may be derived from chlorophyll in plant extracts.
Phytanic acid derives from the corresponding alcohol, phytol, and is oxidized into pristanic acid.
It can also characterize a precise human pathology, Refsum's syndrome.
This inherited neurological disorder is characterized by an accumulation of a normal metabolite of phytol (phytanic acid) in blood and tissues, and the disorder was later found to be related to deficiency in the oxidation pathway in the liver.
Freshwater sponges contain terpenoid acids such as 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic, phytanic and pristanic acids, which indicates that these acids may have chemotaxonomical significance for both marine and freshwater sponges.
Phytanic acid accumaltes in the fat of ruminant animals.
Most animals lack the necessary enzyme to cleave phytol from chlorophyll.
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) can be categorized into three genetically distinct HRV groups, designated groups A, B, and C, within the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae.
HRVs are positive-sense, single-stranded-RNA (ssRNA) viruses of approximately 7,200 bp. HRVs, which are the cause of more than one-half of cold like illnesses, are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and sinusitis.
PCR testing for respiratory virus detection has led to the recognition of HRV as a lower respiratory tract pathogen as well, especially in patients with asthma, infants, elderly patients, and immunocompromised individuals.
At this time there are no approved antiviral therapies, and treatment is primarily supportive.
The Mongolian Gerbil is the species commonly kept as a pet in homes and classrooms, but there are around 90 species of Gerbils and Jirds (Gerbils' relatives in the genus Meriones).
Direct or indirect contact with animal allergens frequently causes sensitisation.
Animal allergens are major components in house and animal laboratory dust.
The Rosner Index subtracts the clotting time of the pooled normal plasma from the clotting time of patient 1:1 mix.
This result is then divided by the clotting time of the patient plasma.
A higher index value indicates that the addition of normal plasma has not succeeded in correcting the abnormally elevated aPTT, therefore representing the possibility of an inhibitor.
A low index value indicates correction (and therefore points to a factor deficiency).
Generally values >15% are indicative of an inhibitor.
Ornithine is an amino acid that, under the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, yields urea.
Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which eliminates excess nitrogen.
Ornithine is not an amino acid coded by DNA, and in that sense, it is not involved in protein synthesis.
In mammalian non-hepatic tissues, however, the urea cycle is mainly involved in arginine biosynthesis, making ornithine an important metabolic process.
It is not directly a product of the the genetic code because polypeptides containing unprotected ornithines undergo spontaneous lactamization.
This proved to be a problem when ornithine was originally classified among the other 20 naturally occuring amino acids.
Alpha globulins are a group of plasma proteins, belonging to the serpin superfamily, that are highly mobile in alkaline or electrically charged solutions.
They inhibit certain blood proteases; examples include Alpha 1 antitrypsin, alpha 1 antichymotrypsin, and serum amyloid A.
Bacterial resistance to macrolide drugs has increased in conjunction with their heavy use in both medicine and animal husbandry.
While there are a number of mechanisms bacteria use to resist the efficacy of drug treatment, the one used by macrolides is to bind to the large 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and interfere with protein synthesis.
Changes of specific nucleotides in the 23S rRNA inside the large ribosomal unit are the root cause of many instances of bacterial resistance to macrolides.
Minocycline is an antibiotic that was discovered in the 1940s and continues to be widely prescribed.
It belongs to the tetracycline class of drugs and is used to treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.
Minocycline has a high incidence of adverse events associated with its use causing symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and drug-hypersensitivity syndrome.
Allergic reactions to minocycline have involved symptoms of urticaria, angioedema, dyspnea, and hypotension.

Principal metabolite of brain norepinephrine
Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid.
It is called "essential" because it is needed for normal human growth and development.
Nuts, such as walnuts, are good sources of alpha-linolenic acid.
It is also found in vegetable oils such as flaxseed oil, canola oil, and soybean oil, as well as in red meat and dairy products.
Epidemiological studies and dietary trials in humans suggest that alpha-linolenic acid is a major cardio-protective nutrient.
A narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming.
It is nearly as effective orally as by injection.
Glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c; sometimes also HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time.
It is formed in a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose.
Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycated hemoglobin.
As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way.
This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous months prior to the measurement.
The 2010 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes added the A1c â¥ 48 mmol/mol (â¥6.5%) as another criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes.
In diabetes mellitus, higher amounts of glycated hemoglobin, indicating poorer control of blood glucose levels, have been associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy.
Monitoring the HbA1c in type-1 diabetic patients may improve treatment.
A naturally occurring furocoumarin compound found in several species of plants, including Psoralea corylifolia.
It is a photoactive substance that forms DNA ADDUCTS in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation.
Retinal, also called retinaldehyde or vitamin A aldehyde, is one of the many forms of vitamin A. Retinal is a polyene chromophore, and bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of animal vision.
Bound to proteins called type 1 rhodopsins, retinal allows certain microorganisms to convert light into metabolic energy.
Vertebrate animals ingest retinal directly from meat, or produce retinal from one of four carotenoids (beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, gamma-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin), which they must obtain from plants or other photosynthetic organisms (no other carotenoids can be converted by animals to retinal, and some carnivores cannot convert any carotenoids at all).
The other main forms of vitamin A, retinol, and a partially active form retinoic acid, may both be produced from retinal.
Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which derive from conversion from other xanthophylls.
The clot formation lag time is the time from the beginning of the measurement until the beginning of clot growth.
When calculated using time-lapse microscopy (i.e., thrombodynamics or spatiotemporal clot analysis), the lag time is measured from when the activator first contacts the plasma sample until the beginning of the clot growth, which is defined as the point when the light scatter from the growing fibrin clot reaches half of the maximum light scatter from the formed clot at the end of the measurement.
Tipranavir, or tipranavir disodium, is a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor (PI) manufactured by Boehringer-Ingelheim under the trade name Aptivus.

AMP deaminase 1 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the AMPD1 gene.
Myoadenylate deaminase, also called AMP deaminase, is an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), freeing an ammonia molecule in the process.
Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 catalyzes the deamination of AMP to IMP in skeletal muscle and plays an important role in the purine nucleotide cycle.
Two other genes have been identified, AMPD2 and AMPD3, for the liver- and erythrocyte-specific isoforms, respectively.
Deficiency of the muscle-specific enzyme is apparently a common cause of exercise-induced myopathy and probably the most common cause of metabolic myopathy in the human.
A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell in the vertebrate immune system.
A lymphocyte count is usually part of a peripheral complete blood cell count and is expressed as percentage of lymphocytes to total white blood cells counted.
A general increase in the number of lymphocytes is known as lymphocytosis whereas a decrease is lymphocytopenia.
An increase in lymphocyte concentration is usually a sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person).
A low normal to low absolute lymphocyte concentration is associated with increased rates of infection after surgery or trauma.

Uncorrected visual acuity is a measurement of clearness of vision while the patient is not using refractive correction.
Best corrected visual acuity is acuity measurement using corrective lenses, if usually worn.
Visual acuity measured using a Snellen Eye Chart is reported with a numerator of the standard testing distance of 20 and a denominator indicating the distance at which strokes of the smallest letter size viewable subtend at 1 minute of arc.
(e.g., 20/10: with a standard testing distance of 20 feet, the strokes of the smallest letter size viewable would subtend 1 minute of arc at 10 feet, or as more commonly explained, what the patient can see at 20 feet, the average population can see at 10 feet).
If unable to read letters on a testing chart, visual acuity is described as ranging from ability to count fingers, recognize hand motion, perceive bright light, or unable to perceive light.

The OTOF gene (otoferlin) is located on chromosome 2p23.1.
Mutations in this gene are a cause of neurosensory nonsyndromic recessive deafness, DFNB9.
The short form of the encoded protein has 3 C2 domains, a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain found also in the C. elegans spermatogenesis factor FER-1 and human dysferlin, while the long form has 6 C2 domains.
The homology suggests that this protein may be involved in vesicle membrane fusion.
Several transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been found for this gene.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) involves the t(15;17)(PML;RARÎ± )(q22;q12) translocation occurring between the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and the retinoic acid receptor - alpha (RARÎ±) gene, leading to expression of the PML- RARÎ± fusion protein.
This test detects the presence of this translocation by examining the subcellular distribution of PML by Immunofluorescence (IF).
Normally, IF staining for PML using antibodies directed against the PML protein appears as a granular pattern of 5 to 30 discrete intranuclear particles.
This is the case in normal cells.
However, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the PML- RARÎ± fusion protein forms heterodimers with the wild type PML protein.
This sequestration changes the cellular localization of PML such that IF staining becomes more diffuse, known as a microgranular pattern.
Detecting APL is important because quickly beginning therapy with all trans retinoic acid is important for management

Bile acids (BAs) play a primary role in digesting dietary fats.
Primary BAs are produced in the liver by either the classic or alternative pathway.
CYP7A1 controls the production of primary BAs in the liver.
The primary BAs (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) are conjugated to either glycine or taurine to create conjugated primary BAs, which are stored in the gallbladder.
Once released into the intestinal circulation, primary BAs are modified by gut bacteria (e.g., deconjugated) to form secondary BAs.
Secondary BAs are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, and travel back to the liver through the portal circulation.
Different disorders are associated with various patterns of primary and secondary BA levels.
Examples of disorders and their associated BA patterns include: Disorders of BA synthesis (information from ): 1) Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis including cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, Zellweger syndrome, and a variety of other enzyme deficiencies - low or absent BAs 2) Bile acid conjugation defects - increased levels of unconjugated cholic and deoxycholic acid, lack of chenodeoxycholic acid Disorders of BA metabolism (information from ): 1) Inflammatory bowel disease - reduced deconjugation by gut bacteria, lower levels of secondary BAs 2) Irritable bowel syndrome - reduced deconjugation, increased levels of primary conjugated BAs, lower levels of secondary BAs 3) Short bowel syndrome - reduced levels of secondary and tertiary BAs 4) Obesity - lower levels of both primary BAs

Group A spread mainly in West Africa, but also to Angola, Mozambique, Brazil, India, and very limitedly to Europe or the US.
Group B is mainly confined to West Africa.
HIV-2 is mostly related to simian immunodeficiency virus endemic in sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) (SIVsmm), a monkey species inhabiting the forests of littoral West Africa.
Phylogenetic analyses show that the viruses most closely related to the two strains of HIV-2 which spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) are the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western Ivory Coast.
There are six additional known HIV-2 groups, each having been found in just one person.
They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from sooty mangabeys to humans.
Groups C and D have been found in two people from Liberia, groups E and F have been discovered in two people from Sierra Leone, and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the Ivory Coast.
Each of these HIV-2 strains, for which humans are probably dead-end hosts, is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from sooty mangabeys living in the same country where the human infection was found.
Dihydrothymine is an intermediate breakdown product of thymine.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase catalyzes the reduction of thymine to dihydrothymine then dihydropyrimidinase hydrolyzes dihydrothymine to N-carbamyl-b-alanine.
Finally, beta-ureidopropionase catalyzes the conversion of N-carbamyl-b-alanine to beta-alanine.
Patients with dihydropyrimidinase deficiency exhibit highly increased concentrations of 5, 6-dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine and moderately increased concentrations of uracil and thymine in urine.
Paroxetine or paroxetine hydrochloride is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.

The 5-HTTLPR variant in the SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter), member 4) gene is a 44-base pair promoter insertion/deletion polymorphism that has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin uptake in patients.
It may also play a role in sudden infant death syndrome, aggressive behavior in Alzheimer disease patients, and depression-susceptibility in people experiencing emotional trauma.
The serotonin transporter polymorphism results in either a long allele (L) or short allele (S) of the gene.
The "L" allele is associated with normal levels of serotonin transporter, and the "S" allele is associated with reduced serotonin transporter levels and increased risk for depression.

Mitotic index is a measure for the proliferation status of a cell population.
It is defined as the ratio between the number of cells in mitosis and the total number of cells.
Cells in the cell cycle can be identified using antibodies against the nuclear antigen Ki-67.
The mitotic index can be worked out from a slide, even with light microscopy.
It is the number of cells containing visible chromosomes divided by the total number of cells in the field of view.
If you administer colchicine or other colchicine-derivative medications (i.e. colcemid) you can arrest the cell cycle at this point leaving the chromosomes in their visible form.
Colchicine disrupts the microtubule formation which is necessary for the spindle fibers to separate the chromosomes during anaphase.
By quantifying aspects of a dividing cell population, we can examine how cells differ in their capability to divide.
Experimentally, we can change properties of the cell's environment and quantify the effects on cell division.
For a group of cells that rarely complete the cell cycle, we expect a high proportion of cells to be in the resting stage of the cell cycle (G1).
However, in a rapidly dividing cell population, we expect a high proportion of cells to be in the stage of mitosis.
One way to quantify cell division is by using the mitotic index:
Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) are a group of voltage-gated ion channels found in excitable cells (e.g., muscle, glial cells, neurons, etc.) with a permeability to the ion Ca2+.At physiologic or resting membrane potential, VDCCs are normally closed.
They are activated (i.e., opened) at depolarized membrane potentials and this is the source of the "voltage-dependent" epithet.
Activation of particular VDCCs allows Ca2+ entry into the cell, which, depending on the cell type, results in muscular contraction, excitation of neurons, up-regulation of gene expression, or release of hormones or neurotransmitters.

A ribosome is an organelle in cells that assembles proteins.
Ribosomes are composed of ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins (known as a Ribonucleoprotein or RNP).
It translates Messenger RNA (mRNA) into a polypeptide chain (e.g., a protein).
It can be thought of as a factory that builds a protein from a set of genetic instructions.
Ribosomes can float freely in the cytoplasm (the internal fluid of the cell) or bind to the endoplasmic reticulum, or to the nuclear envelope.
Since ribosomes are ribozymes, it is thought that they might be remnants of the RNA world.
Ribosomes were first observed in the mid-1950s by cell biologist George Palade in the electron microscope as dense particles or granules for which he would win the Nobel Prize.
The term ribosome was proposed by scientist Richard B. Roberts in 1958:

Erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs) are the cells in the circulation that carry oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the tissues throughout the body.
They are produced in the bone marrow in response to erythropoietin where they transition through six stages over a seven day period.
When they are released into the circulation, their nucleus has been extruded and they measure 6-8 microns in diameter.
The lifespan of RBCs is about 120 days.
When the RBC ages the cell membrane becomes less pliable and tears as they cell travels through the micro vessels of the body.
The damaged RBCs are removed from the circulation by the spleen.
Variations in number, shape and size of RBCs are indicative of many diseases and disorders.
There are many factors that may lead to decreased numbers of RBCs including hemorrhage, hemolysis, iron or vitamin deficiency, marrow failure and more.
Larger than normal RBCs may be indicative of liver disease while smaller than normal RBCs are seen in thalassemias and other anemias.(Mosby's manual of diagnostic and laboratory tests, Kathleen Deska Pagana; Timothy James Pagana, Elsevier St. Louis, Mo Â©2010)

Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are caused by a defect in glycosylation, primarily of proteins and lipids.
Protein glycosylation naturally occurs in two ways, either through an N-linkage to the amide group of asparagine or an O-linkage to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine.
The majority of known CDG disorders involve protein N-glycosylation, followed by protein O-glycosylation.
Lipid glycosylation disorders have only recently begun to be identified.
The primary screening test for N-glycosylation disorders is serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin analysis, and for O-glycosylation disorders is apolipoprotein CIII analysis.
The symptoms, presentation, and prognosis for different CDGs varies widely.
However, neurological involvement, including seizures, hypotonia, and cognitive impairment, is common, as are bleeding or clotting disorders, feeding disorders leading to failure to thrive, and eye disorders including strabismus and retinal disease.
Patients with O- and lipid glycosylation disorders more commonly have dysmorphic features compared to those who have disorders of N-glycosylation.

It has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated B-cell and T-cell proliferation, and the differentiation of CD4+ T-cells into Th2 cells.
It is a key regulator in humoral and adaptive immunity.
IL-4 induces B-cell class switching to IgE, and up-regulates MHC class II production.
Overproduction of IL-4 is associated with allergies.
APOB, LDLR and PCSK9 are three genes associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
FH associated with APOB and LDLR mutations is more common than that associated with PCSK9.
APOB encodes apolipoprotein B, a primary protein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons.
Mutations in the APOB gene affect the region of apolipoprotein B that binds to the LDL receptor, which results in decreased receptor binding, leading to increased circulating levels of LDL.
LDLR encodes the LDL cell membrane receptor, which binds LDL and transports it into the cell.
LDLR mutations result in defective binding of LDL to the LDL receptor, resulting in increased circulating levels of LDL.
PCSK9 encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme which binds to several different LDL, VLDL and apolipoprotein receptors and promotes their degradation.
Mutations in PCSK9 result in increased enzyme activity, which leads to increased receptor degradation and decreased availability of receptors to bind and transport lipids into the cell.
The end result is an increase in circulating lipid levels.
CD2 is CD58 receptor and identifies T cells and NK subsets.
Buckwheat is grown almost worldwide, but is especially common in China and Iraq.
Its original habitat is obscure.
It is a member of the Polygonaceae group of weeds.
In China another type of Buckwheat, Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tartaricum) is grown and consumed (1).
Buckwheat is consumed mainly in Asian countries, in particular in Japan, where it is a major food allergen due to the popularity of soba (Buckwheat noodles).
POL3RK gene encodes a small essential subunit (known as RP11) of RNA polymerase III, which synthesizes small RNAs such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs.
The POL3RK protein plays a key role in sensing and reducing infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses.
It acts as a sensor involved in innate immune response.
The presence of antibodies directed against POL3RK (anti-Polymerase, DNA-directed) are thought to be associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a connective tissue disease that affects the skin and internal organs.
14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules expressed in all eukaryotic cells.
14-3-3 proteins have the ability to bind a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and transmembrane receptors.
More than 100 signaling proteins have been reported as 14-3-3 ligands.
The name 14-3-3 refers to the particular elution and migration pattern of these proteins on DEAE-cellulose chromatography and starch-gel electrophoresis.
The 14-3-3 proteins eluted in the 14th fraction of bovine brain homogenate and were found on positions 3.3 of subsequent electrophoresis by Moore and Perez.
Elevated amounts of 14-3-3 proteins are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Neisseria meningitides (Nm) is a species of gram-negative, aerobic bacteria.
It is a commensal and pathogen only of humans, and can be carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx.
When found in cerebrospinal fluid it is the causative agent of cerebrospinal meningitis (meningitis, meningococcal).
Nm can also be found in venereal discharges and blood.
At least 13 serogroups have been described based on antigenic differences in the capsular polysaccharides; the ones causing most meningitis infections being A, B, C, Y, and W-135.
Outbreaks caused by serogroup X meningococci have also been reported.
Each serogroup can be further classified by serotype, serosubtype, and immunotype.
The two targets most frequently used in real-time PCR assays to identify Nm are the capsule transport gene (ctrA) and the Cu-An superoxide dismutase gene (sodC).
sodC is found only in Nm and not in other species of Neisseria.
sodC is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of Nm regardless of whether capsule genes are present or absent.
ctrA is likely the target gene most often used to identify Nm, but because it is prone to rearrangement it does not detect roughly 16% of patients with Nm.

Brachyspira pilosicoli is an intestinal spirochete that infects the large intestine of pigs and causes porcine intestinal spirochetosis.
It also infects humans, non-human primates, dogs, several species of birds, and mice, with mice being a probable reservoir of infection for swine.
B. pilosicoli can be grown on modified BJ culture medium that lacks rifampicin and spiramycin, and can be differentiated from other Brachyspira species using biochemical testing.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is required to definitively identify B. pilosicoli.
B. pilosicoli is transmitted by the fecal-oral oral route, and the incubation period of B. piosicoli is 3-16 days.
Symptoms of infection are diarrhea and poor growth for 2-6 weeks.
It is nonfatal in swine.
To definitively diagnose intestinal spirochetosis, the typical colonic leasion must be observed and infection by B. pilosicoli must be confirmed.
Infection of swine with B. pilosicoli occurs in most countries with swine-producing industries.
Mustards were originally identified as members of a small but widespread genus of European and Asiatic herbs named Sinapis, but they are now generally included in the Cabbage genus, Brassica.
All of the Mustard varieties come from species of annually flowering bushes or small trees, which are often experienced as weeds or even destructive pests.
The leaves, Mustard greens, are used as a vegetable.
If leaves are not harvested, strange seed stalks are sent up by the plants, and the condiment is made from the seeds.

Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, includes the parts of plant foods the body can't digest or absorb.
Fiber isn't digested but instead it passes relatively intact through the stomach, small intestine, colon, and out of the body.
Fiber is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn't dissolve.
Total fiber includes both.
Most plant-based foods, such as oatmeal and beans, contain both soluble and insoluble fiber.
A high-fiber diet has many benefits which include: 1) helping to maintain bowel health, 2) lowering cholesterol, 3) helping control blood sugar levels, and 4) aiding in achieving healthy weight.
Lysine is an essential basic amino acid that plays a major role in calcium absorption and the production of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.
Lack of lysine can result in niacin deficiency and cause the pellagra.
Other diseases associated with lysine include hyperlysinemia, lysine intolerance, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, and saccharopinuria (saccharopine is an intermediate in the metabolism of lysine).
Interleukin 7 (IL7) is a protein that is encoded by the IL7 gene in humans.
a hematopoietic growth factor secreted by stromal cells in the red marrow and thymus.
It is also produced by keratinocytes, dendritic cells, neurons and endothelial cells, but is not produced by lymphocytes.
IL-7 stimulates the differentiation of multipotent (pluripotent) hematopoietic stem cells into lymphoid progenitor cells (as opposed to myeloid progenitor cells where differentiation is stimulated by IL-3).
It also stimulates proliferation of all cells in the lymphoid lineage (B cells, T cells and NK cells).
It is important for proliferation during certain stages of B-cell maturation, T and NK cell survival, development and homeostasis.
IL-7 is a cytokine important for B and T cell development.
This cytokine and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) form a heterodimer that functions as a pre-pro-B cell growth-stimulating factor.
This cytokine is found to be a cofactor for V(D)J rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta (TCRB) during early T cell development.
This cytokine can be produced locally by intestinal epithelial and epithelial goblet cells, and may serve as a regulatory factor for intestinal mucosal lymphocytes.
Knockout studies in mice suggested that this cytokine plays an essential role in lymphoid cell survival.
IL-7 receptor knockout mice exhibit thymic atrophy, arrest of T-cell development at the double positive stage, and severe lymphopenia.
Administration of IL-7 to mice results in an increase in thymic migrants, increases in B and T cells, and increased recovery of T cells after cyclophosphamide administration or after bone marrow transplantation.
Il-7 promotes hematological malignacies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T cell lymphoma).

It flowers from July to September.
Phendimetrazine (BontrilÂ®) is a weight loss medication.
Phendimetrazine is chemically related to amphetamines and is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
In the United States, phendimetrazine is a Schedule III controlled substance under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
Phendimetrazine is used clinically in the form of phendimetrazine tartrate.
Approximately 30% of a given dose of phendimetrazine is metabolized into phenmetrazine, which may account for part of its anorectic effect, and probably also influences abuse potential; individuals who metabolise a greater proportion of phendimetrazine into phenmetrazine are more likely to develop problems with dependence and addiction.
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a naturally occurring hallucinogenic drug of the tryptamine family.
This drug is found not only in many plants, but also in trace amounts in the human body, where its natural function remains undetermined.
Structurally, it is analogous to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and other hallucinogenic tryptamines such as 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), and psilocin (4-HO-DMT).
DMT is created in small amounts by the human body during normal metabolism by the enzyme tryptamine-N-methyltransferase.
Many cultures, indigenous and modern, ingest DMT as a psychedelic, in either extracted or synthesized forms
American Licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota) is a species of Glycyrrhiza native to most of North America, from central Canada south through the United States to California, Texas and Virginia, but absent from the southeastern states.
It is also sometimes known in the United States as "wild licorice", to distinguish it from the related European Liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) which is occasionally cultivated
Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes which can yield non-aligned visual images between the right and left eyes.

The BBS10 gene (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10) is located on chromosome 12q21.2.
This gene is a member of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) gene family.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal malformation and mental retardation.
The proteins encoded by BBS gene family members are structurally diverse and the similar phenotypes exhibited by mutations in BBS gene family members are likely due to their shared roles in cilia formation and function.
Many BBS proteins localize to the basal bodies, ciliary axonemes, and pericentriolar regions of cells.
BBS proteins may also be involved in intracellular trafficking via microtubule-related transport.
The protein encoded by this gene is likely not a ciliary protein but rather has distant sequence homology to type II chaperonins.
As a molecular chaperone, this protein may affect the folding or stability of other ciliary or basal body proteins.
Inhibition of this protein's expression impairs ciliogenesis in preadipocytes.
Mutations in this gene cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 10.
The angle between the Sella-Nasion plane and the Palatal plane (ANS-PNS)
Low ionized calcium levels are common in critically ill patients with sepsis, renal failure, cardiac failure, pulmonary failure, post-surgery or burns.
Monitoring of ionized calcium is particularly important in the unconscious or anesthetized patient, in whom unrecognized changes in calcium homeostasis may result in serious cardiovascular dysfunction with little of no prior warning signs.
Decreased ionized calcium levels between 3 and 4 mg/dL are usually well tolerated, but the risk of cardiac arrest increases when ionized calcium levels approach 2.5 mg/dL. An ionized calcium level below 2.8 mg/dL is a reasonable threshold to begin calcium replacement therapy.
Patients with hypotension or low cardiac output may require calcium replacement when ionized calcium falls below 3.2 to 3.6 mg/dL. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored during replacement therapy.
A cyanide is any chemical compound that contains the cyano group -CN, with the carbon atom triple-bonded to the nitrogen atom.
The CN group can be found in many kinds of compounds.
Some are gases, others are solids or liquids.
Some are salt-like, some covalent.
Some are molecular, some ionic, and many are polymeric.
Those that can release the cyanide ion CNË' are highly toxic.
The cyanide anion is an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3) in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells).
It attaches to the iron within this protein.
The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen.
As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy.
Tissues that depend highly on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected.
This is an example of histotoxic hypoxia.
Antibiotic complex obtained from Streptomyces bambergiensis containing mainly Moenomycins A and C.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is DNA that circulates in the plasma, and in pregnant women, cfDNA is both maternal and fetal in origin.
Fetal cfDNA can be detected in maternal plasma as early as 7 weeks' gestation and the proportion of fetal cfDNA increases during the pregnancy.
Fetal cfDNA is continuously added to maternal circulation and is cleared within hours.
Certain noninvasive prenatal screening tests analyze maternal cfDNA to determine the fetal risk for a variety of genetic disorders.
The proportion of cfDNA, calculated as fetal cfDNA/total cfDNA and also known as fetal fraction, is one of the reported measures, and in general, samples with a higher fetal fraction yield more sensitive results than those with lower fetal fraction.
Barbiturates were first developed in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer and were widely distributed by the Farbwerke Fr Bayer and Co in 1904.
Barbiturates offered new treatment to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders profoundly improving their prognoses.
Barbiturates were also used to treat sleep disorders and were the first drugs to effectively treat epileptic seizures.
Due to safety concerns related to drug dependence and overdose and new safer psychoactive medications barbiturate use sharply declined in the 1950s.
Amobarbital is a barbiturate that is used as a hypnotic and sedative.
Physical effects include central nervous system depression and dependence when dosage levels are high.

Serratia species are gram-negative pathogens belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family.
Over 14 species of Serratia have been identified with S. marcescens being the most common clinical isolate.
In the past, it was estimated that only 1-2% of hospital acquired infections, typically of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, surgical wounds or soft tissues, were due to Serratia marcescens.
Results from a recent surveillance program in the US and Europe found that Serratia species were the cause of about 6.5% of all Gram-negative infections in intensive care units (ICUs) and approximately 3.5% in other settings.
Diagnosis of Serratia species infections is made through standard laboratory testing of blood, urine, pus and other bodily fluids.
Severe infections, including meningitis and sepsis, have a high mortality rate.
The TARDBP gene is located on chromosome 1p36.22.

The INR is specifically intented for evaluating protime results on patients stabilized on long term oral anticoagulant therapy.
The INR is not appropriate to evalulate hemostatic function in patients with liver disease, for screening for hereditary factor deficiencies or acquired vitamin K deficiencies, or for routine preoperative screening; this should be evaluated on the normal range in seconds.
INR is calculated by the equation, INR = (PTR) raised to the power of ISI, where ISI = International Sensitivity Index (assigned to each reagent thromboplastin).
PTR = prothrombin time ratio (pat PT/pop mean PT).
Computation of the INR of specific thromboplastin reagent should allow for uniformity in prothrombin time testing regardless of the reagent system or instrumentation used.

Neoplasia (new growth in Greek) is the abnormal proliferation of cells, resulting in a structure known as a neoplasm.
The growth of this clone of cells exceeds, and is uncoordinated with, that of the normal tissues around it.
It usually causes a lump or tumor.
Neoplasms may be benign, pre-malignant or malignant.
A Barr body is the inactive X chromosome in a female somatic cell, or the inactive Z in a male, rendered inactive in a process called lyonization, in those species (including humans) in which sex is determined by the presence of the Y or W chromosome rather than the diploidy of the X or Z.
The Lyon hypothesis states that in cells with multiple X chromosomes, all but one are inactivated during mammalian embryogenesis.
This happens early in embryonic development at random in mammals, except in marsupials and in some extra-embryonic tissues of some placental mammals, in which the father's X chromosome is always deactivated.
Barr bodies are named after their discoverer, Murray Barr.
In men and women with more than one X chromosome, the number of Barr bodies visible at interphase is always one less than the total number of X chromosomes.
For example, men with a 47,XXY karyotype have a single Barr body, whereas women with a 47,XXX karyotype have two Barr bodies.
Barr bodies can be seen on the nucleus of neutrophils.

Retinyl palmitate (RP) is an ester of retinol and palmitic acid.
RP is stored in hepatic stellate cells as lipid droplets in their cytoplasm.
The stored RP comprises 80% of vitamin A in the whole body.
Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, and it helps the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs work properly.
It can be found in meat, poultry, fish and dairy products.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends a daily intake of 5,000 international units (IUs) for everyone over four years old.
Vitamin A can be supplemented orally in the form of vitamin pills or by injection.
Vitamin A testing helps diagnose vitamin A deficiency in patients reporting night blindness, dry eyes, skin and hair, skin thickening, or greyish spots on the eye, or with anemia or diseases impairing nutritional absorption such as Celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or Crohns disease.
Vitamin A deficiencies are rare in the US.
Testing may also be used to detect toxic overdose of vitamin A in patients reporting symptoms including headache, nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, dizziness, joint or muscle pain, hair loss and inflammation of the tongue.
An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties.
The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group -COOH.
Sulfonic acids, containing the group OSO3 H, are relatively stronger acids.
Other groups can also confer acidity, usually weakly: hydroxyl group -OH, -SH, enol group,and the phenol group.
An organic acid is any of various acids containing one or more carboncontaining radicals, such as acetic or formic acid, used in oil and gas well-stimulation treatments.
Inhibited organic acids are much less reactive with metals than are HCl or mixtures of HCl and HF.
For this very reason, organic acids are used at high bottomhole temperatures or when long contact times between acid and pipe are needed.
The relative stability of the conjucate base of the acid determines its acidity.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, is synthesized from glutamate by the pyridoxine dependent enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD).
The first step in the catabolism of GABA involves degradation to succinic semialdehyde in a reaction catalyzed by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T).
Succinic acid is then converted to succinic semialdehyde by the enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH).
GABA is also present in non-neuronal tissues and may exist in peripheral and central tissues in the form of a dipeptide with histidine, as a compound known as homocarnosine.
Several inherited disorders of GABA metabolism have been identified; these are SSADH deficiency, GABA-T deficiency and homocarnosinosis.
The later two are extremely rare and require CSF determination of both free and total GABA.
The clinical presentation of these cases may vary considerably and include psychomotor retardation, convulsions, ataxia, hypotonia, hyperflexia and delayed speech development.
In addition an autosomal recessive disorder has been characterized in a group of patients with pyridoxine-dependent seizures.
In these cases the presumed abnormality is due to reduced binding of pyridoxal-5-phosphate to GAD.
Elevation of CSF free and total GABA are characteristic of GABA-T and SSADH deficiency, where-as low CSF GABA has been reported in pyridoxal-5-phosphate dependent seizures.

Phosphatidic acid (PA) is the acid form of phosphatidate, a part of common phospholipids, major constituents of cell membranes.
Phosphatidic acid is the simplest diacyl-glycerophospholipid.
Ascorbic acid is an essential nutrient in human diets, and is necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone.
The biologically active form of ascorbic acid is vitamin C. Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin.
Primates (including humans) and a few other species in all divisions of the animal kingdom, notably the guinea pig, have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it in their food.
Ascorbic acid is an electron donor for enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, tyrosine metabolism, and amidation of peptide hormones.
Ascrobic acid (vitamin C) deficiency causes scurvy.
The amount of vitamin C necessary to prevent scurvy may not be adequate to maintain optimal health.
The ability of vitamin C to donate electrons also makes it a potent water-soluble antioxidant that readily scavenges free radicals such as molecular oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and hypochlorous acid.
In this setting, several mechanisms could account for a link between vitamin C and heart disease.
One is the relation between LDL oxidation and vitamins C and E. Vitamin C in vitro can recycle vitamin E, which can donate electrons to prevent LDL oxidation in vitro.
As the lipid-phase vitamin E is oxidized, it can be regenerated by aqueous vitamin C. Other possibilities are that vitamin C could decrease cholesterol by mechanisms not well characterized, or could improve vasodilatation and vascular reactivity, perhaps by decreasing the interactions of nitric oxide with oxidants. .
Phthalic anhydride is the anhydride of phthalic acid.
It dissolves in alcohol and some other organic solvents.
Phthalic anhydride is obtained either by catalytic oxidation of ortho -xylene with O2 (oxygen) or by catalytic oxidation of naphthalene.

Fluorides are organic and inorganic compounds containing the element fluorine.
As a halogen, fluorine forms a monovalent ion (Ë'1 charge).
Fluoride forms a binary compound with another element or radical.
Examples of common fluoride compounds include hydrofluoric acid (H F), and sodium fluoride (Na F).
Citrate testing is used to diagnose renal tubular acidosis and evaluate kidney stone disease.
Acid-base balance plays a critical role in citrate excretion.
In acidosis, increased citrate utilization occurs and causes reduced citrate excretion.
In alkalosis, citrate excretion increases.
Hypocitruria promotes the formation of calcium kidney stones because citrate normally binds urinary calcium as a soluble calcium citrate salt.
Hypocitruria may also have a role in uric acid stone formation.
Citrate excretion is impaired by acidosis, hypokalemia, urinary tract infection, and a high animal protein/high acid-ash content diet.
Urine citrate levels may also be decreased with severe muscular activity, hypoparathyroidism, diabetes, and chronic renal failure.
Urine citrate levels may be increased with high carbohydrate diet, estrogen therapy, and Vitamin D use.
A centrocyte generally refers to a B cell with a cleaved nucleus, as may be seen in for example, follicular lymphoma.
During B cell development, centrocytes are formed following the cessation of centroblast proliferation.
The median channel shift (MCS) is used to determine B and T cell crossmatch results.
The MCS is a measure of a patient's antibodies against potential donor antigens.
An MCS value above a certain cutoff, which can vary across laboratories, signifies a positive crossmatch, meaning that a potential recipient has antibodies to donor antigens.
Higher MCS values are associated with increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection.

A 200 Âµg disc distinguished the high-resistance MupRH strains from the other two (MupS or MupRL).
Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist and, when taken at recommended doses, has no physiological effects in the absence of an opioid agonist.
Intravenous naloxone becomes effective within two minutes of injection, but oral or sublingual naloxone has little effect due to its poor absorption.
Therefore, intravenous naloxone is used to treat opioid overdose, and it is used as a sublingual combination with buprenorphine, an opioid agonist-antagonist used to treat chronic opioid-dependence, to lower buprenorphine's abuse potential as follows: when the combination is taken sublingually as prescribed, naloxone exerts little effect and buprenorphine's effects predominate; however, if crushed and injected intravenously, naloxone's antagonist properties reverse the agonist effects of buprenorphine and can precipitate withdrawal.
Nalaxone levels along with its inactive metabolite, naloxone-3-glucuronide (N3G), may be measured to monitor compliance or identify illicit opioid drug use.

The HEXA gene (hexosaminidase A (alpha polypeptide)) is located on chromosome 15q24.1.
This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase that, together with the cofactor GM2 activator protein, catalyzes the degradation of the ganglioside GM2, and other molecules containing terminal N-acetyl hexosamines.
Beta-hexosaminidase is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, which are encoded by separate genes.
Both beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunits are members of family 20 of glycosyl hydrolases.
Mutations in the alpha or beta subunit genes lead to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons and neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses.
Alpha subunit gene mutations lead to Tay-Sachs disease (GM2-gangliosidosis type I).
Coproporhyrin III is a porphyrin metabolite arising from heme synthesis.
Porphyrins are pigments found in both animal and plant life.
Coproporphyrin III is a tetrapyrrole dead-end product from the spontaneous oxidation of the methylene bridges of coproporphynogen, arising from heme synthesis and secreted in feces and urine.
Increased levels of coproporphyrins can indicate congenital erythropoietic porphyria or sideroblastic anaemia.
Porphyria is a pathological state characterised by abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism and results in the excretion of large quantities of porphyrins in the urine and in extreme sensitivity to light.
A large number of factors are capable of increasing porphyrin excretion, owing to different and multiple causes and etiologies: 1) the main site of the chronic hepatic porphyria disease process concentrates on the liver, 2) a functional and morphologic liver injury is almost regularly associated with this chronic porphyria, 3) the toxic form due to occupational and environmental exposure takes mainly a subclinical course.
Hepatic factors includes disturbance in coproporphyrinogen metabolism, which results from inhibition of coproporphyrinogen oxidase as well as from the rapid loss from, and diminished utilization of coproporphyrinogen in the hepatocytes, which may also explain why coproporphyrin, its autoxidation product, predominates physiologically in the urine; decreased biliary excretion of coproporphyrin leading to a compensatory urinary excretion, so that the coproporphyrin ring isomer ratio (1:III) becomes a sensitive index for impaired liver function and intrahepatic cholestasis; and disturbed activity of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
In itself, secondary coproporphyrinuria is not associated with porphyria symptoms of a hepatologic-gastroenterologic, neurologic, or dermatologic order, even though coproporphyrinuria can occur with such symptoms.

Noninvasive prenatal screening is used to assess fetal risk for various genetic conditions without requiring invasive maternal procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma comes from both fetal and maternal sources, and various platforms have been developed using cfDNA to determine fetal risk.
Natera's Panorama prenatal screening test uses a single blood sample from a pregnant woman, and using their proprietary informatics analysis method (NATUS), effectively subtracts the maternal genotype (from WBC DNA) from the cfDNA genotype and analyzes the remaining fetal cfDNA genotype for a variety of conditions including aneuploidy (e.g., Trisomy 21, Monosomy X) and microdeletions (e.g., 22q11.2 deletion).
Specific results are typically reported for each individual condition and summarized for the report as a whole -- if the risk of any individual condition is high, the overall interpretation is "high risk," and if all the individual risks are low, the overall interpretation is "low risk.
In addition, the genetic counselor who reviews the results may add specific interpretation details or follow-up recommendations to the report.

Clot growth is expressed as an increase in length over time and is related to the propagation stage of blood coagulation.
When calculated using time-lapse microscopy (i.e., thrombodynamics or spatiotemporal clot analysis), if there is no spontaneous clotting, the growth velocity is calculated as the average growth velocity between 15-25 minutes after the beginning of clot growth and is called the stationary growth velocity.
If spontaneous clotting is present, then clot growth (called initial clot growth) is calculated based on growth during the 5-minute interval preceding the appearance of spontaneous clots.

Rh is the most complex of the blood groups systems, embracing over 45 distinct antigens, the absence or presence of which combine to exhibit an individual's Rh blood group type.
The most clinical important antigen, D or Rho, was the first discovered in 1940 and has been generally referred to as the Rh antigen, being present in over 85% of the random population.
Those individuals that lack the D antigen are considered to be Rh negative.
The Rh antigens are encoded by two highly homologous and closely linked genes on the short arm of chromosome 1.
The RHD gene producing the D antigen, or most of its components; RhCE gene producing the Cc and Ee antigens or their variants.
The majority of the antigens within this system represent products of gene cross-over, point mutations or deletions within one or both genes.
The Rh antigens appear to be red cell specific, appearing early during development of red blood cells, and have not been found on other body tissues.
Antibodies against the Rh antigens have caused severe and fatal transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease of the newborn.
The importance of the Rh antigens in the erythroid membrane is exemplified by the fact that in many examples of auto-immune hemolytic anemia, auto-Rh antibodies are frequently found.

Clostridium baratii and the more commonly known C. botulinum are gram positive, anaerobic bacteria that produce a potent neurotoxin (BoNT) that binds to presynaptic nerve terminals preventing release of acetylcholine, blocking neurotransmission.
Both C. botulinum Toxin types A, B, E, F and C. baratii type F can produce severe, potentially fatal illness in humans.
Illness can occur as foodborne botulism which occurs when a person ingests pre-formed toxin that leads to illness within a few hours to days.
Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because the contaminated food may still be available to other persons besides the patient.
Infant botulism occurs in a small number of susceptible infants each year who become infected when C. botulinum or C. baratii bacteria grow in their intestinal tract.
Wound botulism occurs when open skin lesions or wounds are infected with C. botulinum that secretes the toxin.
It is also important to recognize that C. botulinum and C. baratii and the associated toxins are on the Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA list of Select Agents that could be used as weapons of bioterrorism.
For this reason, it is necessary to have a rapid testing procedure that can determine if this toxin could be present in patient samples.

Other studies have shown that patients with heart failure of varying etiologies also have a higher WR compared to controls, and an elevated WR may be an indicator for the risk of sudden cardiac death and fatal arrhythmias.
However, patients who respond to treatment with beta blockers and/or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, as evidenced by improvement in NYHA functional class, have been found to have a decrease in WR on follow-up imaging studies.
5 alpha-Tetrahydrocortisol is a normal human metabolite.
However its increased ratio (5alpha-Tetrahydrocortisol + Tetrahydrocortisol) over Tetrahydrocortisone in urine is the biochemical marker for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).
AME is a heritable form of hypertension due to an inborn error of cortisol metabolism and is characterized by hypokalemia and low renin levels despite subnormal or normal levels of aldosterone and other known mineralocorticoids.
The syndrome is attributable to congenital deficiency of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD), which converts cortisol to biologically inactive cortisone.
This results in a prolonged half-life of Cortisol, which acts at the kidney level as a potent mineralocorticoid.

Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).
Signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
In rare cases, symptoms of this disorder first appear during adulthood.
People with MCAD deficiency are at risk for serious complications such as seizures, breathing difficulties, liver problems, brain damage, coma, and sudden death.
Problems related to MCAD deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections.
This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu.
Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.

Guanidinoacetate is the immediate precursor of creatine.
Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) is the enzyme responsible for converting guanidinoacetate to creatine, and GAMT deficiency causes is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder whose manifestations include seizures, developmental delay, learning difficulties, and autism.
Motor function is relatively spared.
GAMT deficiency leads to elevated levels of plasma and urine guanidinoacetate, and low plasma creatine and creatinine levels.
Elevated levels of guanidinoacetate in the brain are one cause of seizures in patients with GAMT deficiency.
The primary treatment is creatine supplementation, which may be combined with ornithine supplementation and arginine restriction.
Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent organ damage and preserve cognitive function.
If the diagnosis does not occur early and brain damage has already occurred at the time of diagnosis, creatine supplementation can still help control seizures and improve quality of life.

Lipids are a class of hydrocarbon -containing organic compounds essential in providing stored energy and organ protection within a living organism.
Lipids are categorized by the fact that they are soluble in nonpolar solvents (such as ether and chloroform) and are relatively insoluble in water.
Lipid molecules have these properties because they consist of mainly carbon.
Some lipids are used for energy storage, others serve as structural components of cellular membranes, and some are important hormones.
Although the term lipid is often used as a synonym for fat, the latter is in fact a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides.

The order Enterobacterales consists of over 250 species of Gram-negative bacteria contained within seven families (Budviciaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Erwiniaceae, Hafniaceae, Morganellaceae, Pectobacteriaceae, and Yersiniaceae) and many genera.
Enterobacterales was originally proposed in 2005 under the name "Enterobacteriales" but later reclassified in 2016 as Enterobacterales with the proposed seven families.
At that time, several genera that were formerly classified as Enterobacteriaceae were reclassified into new families.
Many of the genera and species within the order are associated with common health-care associated infections, including bloodstream infections (BSI).
Treatment for BSI and other infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria has become more complex with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacterales, particularly Enterobacteriaceae.
Procoagulant phospholipids (PPLs), especially phosphatidylserine, are essential for the assembly of the coagulation complex (Mann et al, 1992), including tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, factor Ixa-factor VIIIa complex and factor Xa-factor Va complex, which leads ultimately to thrombin generation.
Platelet procoagulant activity is primarily due to surface exposure of anionic phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylserine, normally present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane.
Membrane remodeling also releases microparticles (MPs), which are fragments released from stimulated or apoptotic cells.
MPs are rich in procoagulant phospholipids and increase procoagulant activity in many disease processes including; cardiovascular disorders, certain cancers, inflammatory syndromes, infectious diseases, obstetric complications, and others.

Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori are the three species of filaria that cause lymphatic filariasis in humans living in the tropics and sub-tropics.
Infection is spread from person to person by mosquito bites.
The adult worms live and reproduce in the human lymphatic system, creating millions of microscopic worms called microfilariae.
When a person who is infected is bitten by a mosquito, the mosquito becomes infected, and the microfilariae mature inside the mosquito.
When the mosquito bites another person, the larval worms are passed from the mosquito to the human and travel to the lymphatic system, where they grow into adult worms.
Most people with lymphatic filariasis are asymptomatic, and a few develop lymphedema, primarily in the legs, but also in the arms, breasts, and genitals.
People with lymphedema are more susceptible to bacterial infections of the skin and lymphatic system, which can lead to hardening and thickening of the skin, also known as elephantiasis.
Filarial infection can also cause tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome.
Lymphatic filariasis primarily develops in people who have gotten mosquito bites in an endemic area over an extended period of time.
Studies have shown that different IgG isotypes may characterize different stages of infection.
IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 are most common in asymptomatic patients, while IgG4 is a marker of active infection.
In addition, larval antigens may have a stronger IgG1 response, followed by IgG2 and IgG3, while IgG4 is the most common isotype found in response to adult filaria.

Deep transitional epithelial cells may have various shapes but they mostly ovoid or cube-like appearance, with one well evident nucleus
In oval cells this is in a central location, while in club-like cells it is usually peripheral.
The diameter of these cells may be quite variable, from about 10 Âµm (for oval cells) up to more than 30 Âµm (for club-like cells).
Cells from the deep layers are found in the urine in urological conditions which damage the uroepithelium in all its thickness such as urolithiasis, bladder carcinoma or hydronephrosis.
The superficial transitional cells are much larger than those of the deep layers, their size ranging from about 17 to 43 Âµm.
Their shape varies from round to oval, with a round or oval nucleus in a central or slightly off-center location.
At times a clear peri-nuclear halo can be seen.
Often, they also appear in clumps.
Cells of the superficial layers are much more frequent than deep transitional cells, since even mild injuries to the uroepithelium can cause their detachment from the uroepithelial mucosa.
Cystitis is the condition most frequently associated with the finding of these cells in the urine.

Fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, is primarily produced in bone and helps regulate phosphate and vitamin D metabolism by binding to receptors on renal tubular cells.
It is produced as a 251-amino acid precursor consisting of a signal peptide, N-terminal domain, and C-terminal domain.
The bioactive form of FGF23 consists of the N- and C-terminal domains, after the signal peptide is removed, and is also called the "intact" form.
Intact FGF23 is cleaved into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, which are no longer active, though the C-terminal fragment may compete with intact FGF23 for renal tubule receptors and play a role in regulating overall FGF23 activity.
The production of FGF23 is regulated by a variety of factors, including calcium and phosphate levels, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and iron deficiency.

Creatinine or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle.
The loss of water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine.
It is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated by glomular filtration and partial tubular excretion.
Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate and measuring its serum level is a simple test.
A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease.
Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

Sulfonamide is the basis of several groups of drugs.
The original antibacterial sulfonamides (sometimes called simply sulfa drugs) are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain the sulfonamide group.
Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity, e.g., the anticonvulsant sultiame.
The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based on the antibacterial sulfonamides.
Sulfa allergies are common, hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully.
It is important to make a distinction between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically unrelated to the sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.

Norovirus (NV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Caliciviridae family.
It was previously known as the 'Norwalk-like virus'.
Of the six known genogroups of NV, only three are known to infect humans and include GI, GII, and GIV.
Within these three genogroups 25 genotypes have been discovered, which is why people can be infected multiple times throughout their lives.
Infection with NV causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines which leads to non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, fever, headache, and body aches.
Symptoms persist for 1-3 days, but NV can be found in stool samples of infected people for up to two weeks after symptoms subside.
The virus is highly contagious and is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, by contact with infected people, and by contact with contaminated surfaces or substances.
NV is the primary cause of food-related illness in the United States.
The most common genotype of NV that is responsible for outbreaks since 2002 is GII.4.
NV spreads quickly in closed spaces such as daycare centers, nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships.
Diagnostic tests for NV include those that detect the viral RNA or a viral antigen in stool.

Trimethyllysine (N6,N6,N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine) is a methylated derivative of the amino acid lysine.
It is a component of histone proteins, a precursor of carnitine and a coenzyme of fatty acid oxidation.
N6,N6,N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine residues are found in a number of proteins and are generated by the action of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on exposed lysine residues.
When trimethyllysine is released from cognate proteins via proteolysis, it serves as a precursor for carnitine biosynthesis.
Mitochondrial 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase converts 6-N-trimethyllysine to 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine as the first step for carnitine biosynthesis.
Because the subsequent carnitine biosynthesis enzymes are cytosolic, 3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine must be transported out of the mitochondria by a putative mitochondrial 6-N-trimethyllysine/3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine transporter system.
Plasma -N-trimethyllysine concentrations are significantly lower in systemic carnitine deficiency patients compared to normal individuals, but no significant difference in urinary -N-trimethyllysine excretion is seen between the two groups.

Signs and symptoms of VLCAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), lack of energy (lethargy), and muscle weakness.
Affected individuals are also at risk for serious complications such as liver abnormalities and life-threatening heart problems.
When symptoms begin in adolescence or adulthood, they tend to be milder and usually do not involve the heart.
Histoplasmosis capsulatum is a dimorphic fungal pathogen with filamentous or yeast forms,depending on nutritional factors and temperature.
The M antigen is a well-known glycoprotein used as a diagnostic antigen for acute histoplasmosis as it induces the first precipitins during disease.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the M antigen have been found to modify the pathogenesis of histoplasmosis.
Given the shortcomings of current therapies, the administration of mAbs is being investigated.
The H band is less commonly seen than the M band and is indicative of chronic or severe acute infections with H capsulatum.
H. capsulatum is found in nature primarily as a saprophytic mold.
The mold form is comprised of hyaline septate hyphae, which produce two different asexual reproduction structures, macroconidia and microconidia.
The micronidia are believed to be responsible for disease propagation since their 2-6 Âµm size is well suited for disposition into the distal alveoli.
Infection is typically acquired through inhalation of fungal propagules upon disturbances of contaminated soil or excreta.
Environmental and genetic factors influence disease manifestations which can range from asymptomatic or mild influenza-like disease to a disseminated sepsis form.
Manifestations depend on the magnitude of exposure, the host's immunological status and the virulence of the infective strain.

The anti-CD20 mAB Ofatumumab (Genmab) was approved by FDA in Oct 2009 for Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Nucleated cells are defined as any cell with a nucleus; the types of nucleated cells present depend on the specimen source.
White blood cells are a common type of nucleated cell and can be further broken down into types of white blood cells (e.g., neutrophils, lympohcytes, eosinophils); mature red blood cells typically do not have a nucleus.
One important application of the nucleated cell count and differential is in bone marrow analysis.
Nucleated cells found in bone marrow include myeloid cells, which include blast cells, myelocytes, segmented neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes and plasma cells, and erythroid cells (erythroblasts, or immature red blood cells).
The total number of nucleated cells (TNC) is important as well as the myeloid:erythroid ratio and both types of information can be used together to help differentiate between different disorders.
In addition, bone marrow transplants with a higher non-erythroid nucleated cell dose are associated with better outcomes for the transplant recipients.
In medicine, Homans' sign is a sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
A positive sign is present when there is pain in the calf or popliteal region with examiner's abrupt dorsiflexion of the patient's foot at the ankle while the knee is flexed to 90 degrees This sign is frequently elicited in clinical practice because of the ease of use, although it is falling into disfavor because of poor reliability and because it is frequently positive in individuals without DVT.
A positive Homans' sign does not positively diagnose DVT (poor positive predictive value), and a negative Homans' sign does not rule out the DVT diagnosis (poor negative predictive value).
The use of Homans' sign is now discouraged by some as it may unlodge a thrombus leading to a thromboembolic event.

16-Ketoandrostenediol (also known as 16-oxoandrostenediol or 3 beta,17 beta-dihydroxyandrost-5-en-16-one) is a naturally occurring androgenic steroid hormone generated by the adrenal glands.
It has been found in the urine of newborn infants.
Secretion of this steroid is suppressed by dexamethasone.
Levels of this hormone are almost absent by 5 months of age.
((Steroids (1964), 3(1), 77-83.)).
16-Ketoandrostenediol is a natural hormone with androgenic activity and that two potent antiandrogens: hydroxyflutamide (Eulexin) and bicalutamide (Casodex).
The CYP2E1 gene (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily E, polypeptide 1) is located on chromosome 10q26.3.
This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes.
The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids.
This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is induced by ethanol, the diabetic state, and starvation.
The enzyme metabolizes both endogenous substrates, such as ethanol, acetone, and acetal, as well as exogenous substrates including benzene, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene glycol, and nitrosamines which are premutagens found in cigarette smoke.
Due to its many substrates, this enzyme may be involved in such varied processes as gluconeogenesis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, and cancer.
Taenia solium, also called the pork tapeworm, is a cyclophyllid cestode in the family Taeniidae.
It infects pigs and humans in Asia, Africa, the Philippines, Latin America, parts of Southern Europe, and pockets of North America.
In Muslim countries, and in Israel, it is found only very rarely, due to religious dietary restrictions.
Like all cyclophyllid cestodes, T. solium has four suckers on its scolex (head).
T. solium also has two rows of hooks.
T. solium has a very similar life cycle to Taenia saginata, the beef tapeworm, with a few differences.
Though humans usually serve as a definitive host, eating infected meat, fostering adult tapeworms in the intestine, and passing eggs through feces, sometimes a cysticercus (a larva sometimes called a bladder worm) develops in the human and the human acts like an intermediate host.
This happens if eggs get to the stomach, usually as a result of contaminated hands, but also of vomiting.
Single stranded DNA is a DNA molecule that consists of a single strand as opposed to typical double stranded DNA that cosists of two strands of nucleotides in helical form.
Antibody to single stranded DNA is present in numerous systemic rheumatic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis).
Macrocytosis is the enlargement of red blood cells with near-constant hemoglobin concentration, and is defined by a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of greater than 100 femtolitres (the precise criterion varies between laboratories).
Most commonly (especially when the increase in size is mild, and just above normal range)
the etiology is bone marrow dysplasia primary to alcohol abuse and Chronic alcoholism.
Other causes may include: Megaloblastosis (Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency; or DNA synthesis-inhibiting drugs), hypothyroidism, reticulocytosis (commonly from hemolysis or a recent history of blood loss), liver disease, myeloproliferative disease

Cefquinome is also active against many strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci.
Casein is the predominant phosphoprotein found in fresh milk and cheese.
When coagulated with rennet, casein is sometimes called paracasein.
In milk, casein exists as a salt of calcium not coagulated by heat.
It is precipitated by acids and by rennet, a proteolytic enzyme typically obtained from the stomachs of calves.
Casein consists of a fairly high number of proline residues and it has no disulphide bridges.
As a result, it has relatively little secondary or tertiary structures, thus making it difficult to be denatured.
In addition, casein is relatively hydrophobic resulting in low solubility in water.

Theobroma cacao (Mayan: kakaw, Nahuatl: Cacahuatl), also cacao tree and cocoa tree, is a small (4-8 m or 15-26 ft tall) evergreen tree in the family Sterculiaceae (alternatively Malvaceae), native to the deep tropical region of the Americas.
Its seeds are used to make cocoa powder and chocolate.
Phytosterols (e.g., Î²-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol) are common components of plant foods,such as vegetable oils, seeds, and nuts.
An average Western diet contains approx.
200-400 mg of phytosterols per day.
Phytosterols are structurally similar to cholesterol and differ only in the number of carbons or double bonds in the side chain.
Since serum and tissue phytosterols are derived from intestinal absorption, levels reflect dietary plant sterol intake and intestinal absorption.
Markedly increased serum phytosterol concentrations (e.g., Î²-sitosterol > 50 mg/l) is seen in sitosterolemia, a rare autosomal recessive lipid disorder.
These patients develop premature coronary heart disease.
A study suggests that even slightly increased campesterol (3.8 Â± 1.6 mg/l) and Î²-sitosterol (3.1 Â± 1.1 mg/l) concentrations in serum may contribute to the risk of coronary heart disease.
Tryptophoan (or L-tryptophan) is an amino acid, a protein building block that can be found in many plant and animal proteins.
L-tryptophan is called an "essential" amino acid because the body can't make it.
It must be acquired from food.
L-tryptophan is used for insomnia, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, facial pain, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), smoking cessation, grinding teeth during sleep (bruxism), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette's syndrome, and to improve athletic performance.
L-tryptophan is naturally found in animal and plant proteins.
L-tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid because our bodies can't make it.
It is important for the development and functioning of many organs in the body.
After absorbing L-tryptophan from food, our bodies convert it to 5-HTP (5-hyrdoxytryptophan), and then to serotonin.
Serotonin is a hormone that transmits signals between nerve cells.
It also causes blood vessels to narrow.
Changes in the level of serotonin in the brain can alter mood.
The SPG11 gene (spastic paraplegia 11 (autosomal recessive)) is located on chromosome 15q14.
The protein encoded by this gene is a potential transmembrane protein that is phosphorylated upon DNA damage.
Defects in this gene are a cause of spastic paraplegia type 11 (SPG11).
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Amyloid beta (AÎ² or Abeta) is a peptide of 36-43 amino acids that is processed from the Amyloid precursor protein.
While it is most commonly known in association with Alzheimer's disease, it does not exist specifically to cause disease.
Evidence has been found that AÎ² has multiple non-disease activities.
The most common isoforms are AÎ²40 and AÎ²42; the shorter form is typically produced by cleavage that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the longer form is produced by cleavage in the trans-Golgi network.
The AÎ²40 form is the more common of the two, but AÎ²42 is the more fibrillogenic and is thus associated with disease states.
Mutations in APP associated with early-onset Alzheimer's have been noted to increase the relative production of AÎ²42, and thus one suggested avenue of Alzheimer's therapy involves modulating the activity of Î² and Î³ secretases to produce mainly AÎ²40.
Increases in either total AÎ² levels or the relative concentration of both AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 (where the former is more concentrated in cerebrovascular plaques and the latter in neuritic plaques) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
Due to its more hydrophobic nature, the AÎ²42 is the most amyloidogenic form of the peptide.
The use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is increasing significantly and it is important that it be used in conjunction with appropriate laboratory monitoring.
The chief functional difference between standard (unfractionated) heparin and LMWH is that standard heparin has equivalent inhibitory activity against both factor Xa and thrombin (by binding to and potentiating antithrombin), while LMWH, on account of its shorter polysaccharide chains, preferentially inactivates factor Xa.
LMWH has more favorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability than standard heparin with a considerably longer plasma half-life, and produces a more predictable anticoagulant response.
These properties allow LMWH to be administered only once or twice per day.
Methamphetamine (MA) is a drug of abuse also referred to as meth, crystal and speed.
It is a central nervous system stimulant that can be injected, smoked, snorted or ingested.
Short-term MA abuse causes an increase of energy, sense of well-being and decreased appetite that lasts 6-8 hours.
MA use can lead to stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, stomach cramps, shaking, anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, hallucinations, and structural changes to the brain.
Pregnant women who use MA can cause growth retardation, premature birth, and developmental disorders in neonates and long lasting intellectual deficits to the children as they grow.
Users addicted to MA experience withdrawal symptoms that include dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia and an increased appetite.
In chronic MA users positron emission tomography has proven a decrease in dopamine D2 receptors which is associated with mental deterioration that can be reversed to some extent after abstaining from MA.
The presence of red blood cells within the cast is always pathologic, and strongly indicates glomerular damage, which can occur in glomerulonephritis from various causes or vasculitis, including Wegener's granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis or Goodpasture's syndrome.
They can also be associated with renal infarction and subacute bacterial endocarditis.

Establishments that process blood products regulated by the FDA need to register with the FDA.
The information in the blood establishment registration electronic file includes the address, contact information, and types of blood processed at the establishment.
The FDA will use that information for various purposes including for inspectors when they visit the site.
The establishment will notify the FDA when their registration is temporarily being inactivated.
Monosomy X risk refers to the fetus's risk of having monosomy X, also known as Turner syndrome.
The risk can be estimated based on gestational age as well as prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.Monosomy X is caused by the presence of a single normal copy of chromosome X in each cell rather than 2 normal copies of X or one X and one Y chromosome.
In many cases, critical portions of the second X chromosome may be missing rather than the entire chromosome.
Turner syndrome is associated with ovarian dysfunction, short stature and other characteristic physical features, and up to half of girls with Turner syndrome have congenital heart disease.
Turner syndrome is not associated with cognitive delay.
The general population risk of monosomy X is about 1 in 2,500 live female births, and does not change with maternal age.

Genetic testing is performed to identifying patients who are poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.
A polymorphism is associated with greatly decreased activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme.
Newborn screening is the process of testing newborn babies for treatable genetic, endocrinologic, metabolic and hematologic diseases.
Robert Guthrie is given much of the credit for pioneering the earliest screening for phenylketonuria in the late 1960s using blood samples on filter paper obtained by pricking a newborn baby's heel on the second day of life to get a few drops of blood.
Congenital hypothyroidism was the second disease widely added in the 1970s.
The development of tandem mass spectrometry screening by Edwin Naylor and others in the early 1990s led to a large expansion of potentially detectable congenital metabolic diseases that affect blood levels of organic acids.
Additional tests have been added to many screening programs over the last two decades.
Newborn screening has been adopted by most countries around the world, though the lists of screened diseases vary widely.
Plasmin, an enzyme that degrades many blood plasma proteins (most notably fibrin clots) is released as a zymogen called plasminogen (PLG) from the liver into the systemic circulation.
Two major glycoforms of plasminogen are present in humans - type I plasminogen contains two glycosylation moieties (N-linked to N289 and O-linked to T346), whereas type II plasmingen contains only a single O-linked sugar (O-linked to T346).
Type II plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type I glycoform.
Conversely, type I plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots.
Plasminogen deficiency in mice leads to defective liver repair, defective wound healing, reproductive abnormalities.
In human, a rare disorder called plasminogen deficiency type I (Online 'Mendelian Inheritance in Man' is caused by mutations of the PLG gene and is often manifested by ligneous conjunctivitis.
Octreotide (brand name Sandostatin, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is an octapeptide that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though it is a more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than the natural hormone.

Though a major veterinary pathogen, its effect on humans has not been firmly established.
Demeclocycline (marketed as DeclomycinÂ®, DeclostatinÂ® and LedermycinÂ®) is a member of the tetracycline antibiotics group used in various types of bacterial infections.
One of its other registered uses is the treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium concentration) due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) where fluid restriction alone has been ineffective.
It is derived from the Streptomyces aureofaciens fungal strain.
Mode of action:Its use as an antibiotic is particularly in Lyme disease, acne and bronchitis.
Resistance is gradually becoming more common.
As with related tetracycline antibiotics, demeclocycline acts by binding to the 30S- and 50S-RNA, which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria.
It is therefore bacteriostatic (it impairs bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria directly).
Demeclocycline is rarely used for infections.
Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats.
It is in the same class of diseases as BSE in cattle and Chronic Wasting Disease in elk and deer.
Transmission of the classical scrapie agent is not completely understood but apparently healthy sheep infected with the agent can transmit disease.
The infecting agent or prion is a mal-formed version (PrPsc) of a normal protein (PrP) found in all animals.
The malformation of the normal prion proteins occurs when they are exposed to the mal-formed version of the protein.
The normal prion proteins may be more or less susceptible to malformation when they are exposed to the mal-formed protein based on their genetic makeup.
Resistance or susceptibility has been linked to the presence of certain amino acids at various locations within the normal protein.
Genotyping determines the amino acids present at specific locations or codons in the prion protein.
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant animals for breeding and eradication.
Codons associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie include codon 112, 136, 141, 154 and 171.
Codon 154 codes for either arginine Â® or histidine (H).
The presence of H at codon 154 has been associated with increased resistance to scrapie.
Distinguishing between large B-cell lymphomas is critical because the different forms often require distinct management.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form, making up 30-40% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
DLBCL is defined pathologically by large neoplastic cells with B-cell derivation and clinically by aggressive presentation, but differs from its former putative subtype, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), which is believed to arise from thymic medullary B cells.
Since 2001, the WHO has recognized PMBCL as a distinct clinicopathologic disease from DLBCL, with likely distinct treatment options.
PMBCL accounts for approximately 2% of patients with NHL, and tends to affect younger patients..
PMBCL is generally not further subclassified during a patient workup, whereas DLBCL can be further subdivided by cell of origin (COO) into germinal center type and non-germinal center (activated B-cell) type, the latter having significantly worse response to certain treatments .
A species of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria isolated from the intestinal tract of swine, poultry, and man.
It may be pathogenic.
Surfactant is a naturally occurring substance made of six lipids and four proteins that is produced in the lungs.
Surfactant reduces the surface tension of fluid in the lungs and helps make the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) more stable and keeps them from collapsing.
In preparation for breathing air, fetuses begin making surfactant between 24 and 28 weeks gestation.
Babies born very prematurely often lack adequate surfactant, and need to be given surfactant replacement therapy immediately after birth in order to breathe.
A plant species of the genus CYNARA, family ASTERACEAE.
The flower bud is the familiar artichoke eaten as a vegetable.
An important soluble regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation (COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION PATHWAY, ALTERNATIVE).
It is a 139-kDa glycoprotein expressed by the liver and secreted into the blood.
It binds to COMPLEMENT C3B and makes iC3b (inactivated complement 3b) susceptible to cleavage by COMPLEMENT FACTOR I. Complement factor H also inhibits the association of C3b with COMPLEMENT FACTOR B to form the C3bB proenzyme, and promotes the dissociation of Bb from the C3bBb complex (COMPLEMENT C3 CONVERTASE, ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY).
Staphylococcus aureus group II strains are associated with skin infections, and the sau3AI gene is conserved across S aureus group II strains.
The gene produces a restriction endonuclease, and the presence of this gene in clinical specimens can be used to identify S aureus group II as one of the pathogens responsible for a specific infection.
A lactose-fermenting bacterium causing dysentery.
Blood group antigens are either sugars or proteins found on the red blood cell membrane and determine the blood group of an individual.
The two primary blood groups are the ABO blood group (types A, B, AB, and O) and Rh blood group (types Rh D-positive or Rh D-negative).
An individual's blood group is crucial to identify during blood transfusions or transplants, since not all blood group antigens are compatible.
Type AB is considered the "universal receiver" because a patient with this blood group may receive type A, B, AB, or O blood in a transfusion or transplant.
Type O is considered the "universal donor" because a patient with this blood group may donate their blood to type A, B, AB, or O during a transfusion or transplant.
Patients that are Rh positive may receive Rh positive or Rh negative blood, but Rh negative patients may only receive Rh negative blood.
Yersinia pestis is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
The infectious agent of bubonic plague, it can also cause pneumonic and septicemic plague.
All three forms have been responsible for high mortality rates in epidemics throughout human history, for example, the Great Plague and the Black Death, the latter of which accounted for the death of approximately one third of the European population in 1347 to 1353.
The role of Y. pestis in the Black Death is debated among historians; some have suggested that the Black Death spread far too rapidly to be caused by Y. pestis.
DNA from Y. pestis has been found in the teeth of those who died from the Black Death, however, and medieval corpses who died from other causes did not test positive for Y. pestis.,
This suggests that Y. pestis was, at the very least, a contributing factor in some (though possibly not all of) the European plagues.
A naphthacene antibiotic that inhibits amino acyl tRNA binding during protein synthesis.
The IDS gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and encodes iduronate 2-sulfatase, a lysososomal enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan metabolism.
IDS gene mutations are associated with mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPSII), also known as Hunter syndrome.
Hunter syndrome is an X-linked disorder with severe and attenuated forms.
The severe form is characterized by severe airway obstruction, skeletal deformities, cardiomyopathy, neurologic decline, and death by age 20, while the attenuated form is more variable and can be associated with a normal life expectancy.
An intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis, found in the testis or the adrenal glands.
Androstenediol, derived from DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE by the reduction of the 17-keto group (17-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASES), is converted to TESTOSTERONE by the oxidation of the 3-beta hydroxyl group to a 3-keto group (3-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASES).
The BRCA2 gene (breast cancer 2, early onset) is located on chromosome 13q12.3.
Inherited mutations in BRCA1 and this gene, BRCA2, confer increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair.
The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which functions in DNA repair.
BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1) is a peptide hormone responsible for the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary.

Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) is the most common non-tuberculous bacteria infecting humans and includes Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare.
It is pervasive in the environment including in fresh and saltwater, soil, dust, and in numerous animals including chickens, pigs, dogs, cats and insects.
MAC is transmitted through the air and inhaled into the lungs leading to two models of disease.
The first model is that of a healthy non-smoking patient that mostly affects women over 50 who present with interstitial patterns on chest radiography.
In the second model of MAC the patient has underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive lung disease, old tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis.
These patients are mostly middle-aged or older white men with worsening cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, anorexia and weight loss.
On the radiograph are cavitations with progressive fibronodular opacities (<5mm nodules) which mainly occurs in the upper lung.

It appears as a white crystalline powder with a slight sweet taste.
It may form in excess in the lens of the eye in GALACTOSEMIAS, a deficiency of GALACTOKINASE.
Pregnancy ultrasound terms in LOINC reflect the structure of radiology order and billing codes for pregnancy.
Therefore, "Multisection for pregnancy" is defined as imaging of the pelvis and a single fetus and "Multisection for pregnancy multiple gestation" is defined as imaging of the pelvis and an additional fetus.
For example, for triplet pregnancies, imaging of the first fetus would be ordered and reported under the "Multisection for pregnancy" code, and imaging of the second and third fetus would be ordered and reported using two instances of the "Multisection for pregnancy multiple gestation" code.
In addition, the codes can be further specified according to "first trimester" or "second or third trimester".
Netilmicin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics.
These antibiotics have the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria.
Netilmicin is not absorbed from the gut and is therefore only given by injection or infusion.

Propionylglycine is an acyl glycine.
Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids.
However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine The level of propionylglycine is elevated in patients with propionic acidemia, which is an inherited deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase.

Coxiella burnetii exists in two antigenic phases called phase I and phase II.
This antigenic difference is important in diagnosis.
In acute cases of Q fever, the antibody level to phase II is usually higher than that to phase I, often by several orders of magnitude, and generally is first detected during the second week of illness.
In chronic Q fever, the reverse situation is true.
Antibodies to phase I antigens of C. burnetii generally require longer to appear and indicate continued exposure to the bacteria.
Thus, high levels of antibody to phase I in later specimens in combination with constant or falling levels of phase II antibodies and other signs of inflammatory disease suggest chronic Q fever.
Antibodies to phase I and II antigens have been known to persist for months or years after initial infection.
Influenza viruses, from the family Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes containing seven to eight gene segments.
Of the five genera in the family, only influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B and C are medically relevant to humans.
Aquatic birds harboring avian IAV are the likely natural reservoir for all known IAV subtypes and are probably the original source of all human pandemic IAV strains.
IAV maintained in wild birds have been associated with stable host switch events to novel hosts, including most often to domestic poultry but also to horses, swine, toothed whales and humans.
The influenza virus life cycle begins with the binding of viral HA to host cell receptors.
Endocytosis and HA-mediated fusion of the viral and cellular membranes occurs.
Viral ribonucleoprotein complexes are released into the cytoplasm, travel to the nucleus, then are replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase complex.
The new viruses are formed and bud when the newly formed ribonucleicprotein complexes and structural proteins reach the plasma membrane.
Further research is needed to better understand how IAVs switch hosts and the viral genetic changes that underlie human adaptation.
IAV causes respiratory infections in humans ranging from asymptomatic to fatal.
Pandemics are attributed to "novel" viruses which possess a viral hemagglutinin (HA) to which humans do not have immunity.
Influenza viruses A and B are single-stranded RNA enveloped viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family.
The symptoms of infection of Influenza A and B include fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, headache, myalgia and malaise.

The influenza viruses spread rapidly in enclosed spaces with a documented rate of infection of 70% following a common source of exposure.
Infection occurs in the respiratory epithelium in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, and the virus can be found in many specimen types, including nasal aspirates, nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and tracheal aspirates.
When infection rates reach epidemic proportions, hospitalization of children and elderly patients rises as does the mortality rates of elderly patients.(Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 11th edition, James H. Jorgensen; Karen C. Carroll; Guido Funke; Michael A Pfaller; Marie Louise Landry; Sandra S. Richter; David W. Warnock)

Ceftazidime is a third generation beta-lactam antibiotic that belongs to the cephalosporin Family of antibiotics.
Its mode of action is to bind to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) that are located on the outer membrane of the bacterium.
When ceftazidime binds to the PBPs, it interferes with the activity of transpeptidase enzymes which prevents the formation of peptidoglycan chains.
Without the peptidoglycan chains, the bacterial septum and cell wall cannot be produced during cell division, which in turn affects the rigidity of the cell wall and leads to cell lysis.
Ceftazidime is more effective against both Gram-negative bacteria and less effective against Gram-positive bacteria than first and second generation cephalosporins.

In chemistry, a carbonate is a salt or ester of carbonic acid, characterized by the presence of the carbonate ion, CO2â3 or a carbonate functional group O=C(O-)2.
It works as a buffer in the blood as follows: when pH is too low, the concentration of hydrogen ions is too high, so one exhales CO2.
This will cause the equation to shift left, essentially decreasing the concentration of H+ ions, causing a more basic pH. When pH is too high, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (HCO3â).
This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, causing a more acidic pH.

U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is an RNA-protein complex that is composed of ten proteins: U1-70kD, U1A, U1C and seven Smith antigen (Sm) proteins.
The U1 snRNP complex is responsible for pre-mRNA processing.
Autoantibodies to different components of the U1 snRNP complex are associated with autoimmune conditions including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disorders (MCTD), which includes systemic sclerosis.
The pattern of autoantibodies present in an individual patient may help distinguish between different connective tissue disorders.
For example, patients with anti-U1A and anti-U1C IgM antibodies are more likely to have SLE than MCTD.
In addition, there is some evidence that specific antibody patterns are associated with specific symptoms.
For example, among patients with SLE, the combination of anti-U1-70kD, anti-U1A and anti-U1C correlates with Raynaud's phenomenon, while anti-U1-70kD and anti-U1A (without anti-U1C) correlate with leukopenia.
Another study found an association between the number of specific positive antibodies within the anti-U1 snRNP (rather than the presence of particular markers) and certain clinical features.
For example, patients with three or more positive autoantibodies were more likely to have features of systemic sclerosis and less likely to have renal disease compared to patients with fewer types of antibodies.

Mutations resulting in fibrinogen disorders can be either quantitative (afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia) or functional (dysfibrinogenemia), and can affect any of the 3 subunits.
Clinical severity can be highly variable, manifested as bleeding of the CNS GI, GU, skin, or umbilical cord neonatally.
Not surprisingly, those with the lowest levels (below 0.5 g/L) are associated with more severe bleeding.
Those with dysfibrinogenemia can have either bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

Babesia microti is a parasite that invades human red blood cells and is transmitted by the Ixodid scapularis tick.
Infection by the Babesia species was first discovered in Croatia in 1957, but has proven to exist across the world in the last fifty years.
B. microti is the most common babesiosis parasite in the United States.
It was first discovered in the Northeast, but has spread to counties of the lower Hudson River Valley of New York State and on to the upper Midwest.
Thirty-five patients were reported to be infected with B. microti by the Minnesota Department of Health in 2009.
The Babesia parasites possess vesicles that secrete enzymes that facilitates its entrance into the host erythrocytes.
They reproduces asexually in red blood cells and sexually in the Ixodid scapularis tick.
Infection with Babesia leads to a wide range and severity of symptoms.
Symptoms that are characterized as mild to moderate include fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia cough, arthralgia and nausea.
Symptoms of severe illness are seen most often in patients who are immunosuppressed due to infections like Human immunodeficiency virus and conditions such as cancer.
Severe symptoms of Babesia infection include respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, liver and renal failure, and splenic infarction.
There are several ways to diagnose infections with Babesia including thick and thin smear analysis, polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluorescence antibody, and by injecting patient blood into a hamster and waiting for severe parasitemia to develop in 2-4 weeks.
Treatment of Babesia infection is with antibiotics or exchange transfusion when the parasite load in the blood becomes very high.

The most common type of casts, hyaline casts are solidified Tamm-Horsfall mucoproteins secreted from the tubular epithelial cells of individual nephrons.
Low urine flow, concentrated urine, or an acidic environment can contribute to the formation of hyaline casts, and, as such, they may be seen in normal individuals in dehydration or vigorous exercise.
Hyaline casts are cylindrical and clear, with a low refractive index, so that they can easily be missed on cursory review under brightfield microscopy, or in an aged sample where dissolution has occurred.
On the other hand, phase contrast microscopy leads to easier identification.
Given the ubiquitous presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein, other cast types are formed via the inclusion or adhesion of other elements to the hyaline base.

There are several kinds of naturally-occurring saturated fatty acids, which differ by the number of carbon atoms, ranging from 3 carbons (Propionic Acid) to 36 (Hexatriacontanoic acid).
Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds between the carbon atoms of the fatty acid chain and are thus fully saturated with hydrogen atoms.
Fat that occurs naturally in living matter contains varying proportions of saturated and unsaturated fat.
Examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat include dairy products (especially cream and cheese but also butter and ghee), animal fats such as suet, tallow, lard and fatty meat, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, chocolate, and some prepared foods.
Serum saturated fatty acid is generally higher in smokers, alcohol drinkers and obese people.

Hemoglobin Barts is a relatively common hemoglobin variant consisting of four gamma chains.
Hemoglobin Barts is an extremely high affinity hemoglobin that is not effective at delivering oxygen to tissues.
Hemoglobin Barts is only seen during the newborn period and usually indicates that one or more of the baby's alpha-globin genes are deleted, resulting in alpha-thalassemia.
Alpha thalassemia is caused by deletions of the alpha globin genes on chromosome 16.
Normal patients have four copies of the alpha-globin gene, 2 on each chromosome.
A silent carrier will have one deleted alpha gene and usually result in a benign condition.
Alpha thalassmia trait occurs when there are two deleted alpha genes, resulting in mild or no anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia.
Hemoglobin H disease results from the deletion of three alpha genes with resultant moderately severe alpha thalassemia.
Most patients are anemic and display some degree of splenomegaly.
Fetal hydrops syndrome occurs when all four alpha genes are deleted.
Fetal hydrops is not compatible with life and death occurs in utero or during early infancy.
Carrier states for alpha thalassemia are very common in the African, Meditteranean and Asian populations.
In general, only the loss of one or two genes is seen in African Americans.
Asian and Meditteranean populations may have all types of alpha thalassemia.

The BBS2 gene (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2) is located on chromosome 16q21.
This gene is a member of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) gene family.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe pigmentary retinopathy, obesity, polydactyly, renal malformation and mental retardation.
The proteins encoded by BBS gene family members are structurally diverse and the similar phenotypes exhibited by mutations in BBS gene family members is likely due to their shared roles in cilia formation and function.
Many BBS proteins localize to the basal bodies, ciliary axonemes, and pericentriolar regions of cells.
BBS proteins may also be involved in intracellular trafficking via microtubule-related transport.
The protein encoded by this gene forms a multiprotein BBSome complex with seven other BBS proteins.

Lactobacillales or lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are an order of Gram-positive bacteria that are either rod- or coccus-shaped.
These bacteria, usually found in decomposing plants and milk products, produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation.
This trait has, throughout history, linked LAB with food fermentations, as acidification inhibits the growth of spoilage agents.
Proteinaceous bacteriocins are produced by several LAB strains and provide an additional hurdle for spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
Furthermore, lactic acid and other metabolic products contribute to the organoleptic and textural profile of a food item.
The industrial importance of the LAB is further evidenced by their generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, due to their ubiquitous appearance in food and their contribution to the healthy microflora of human mucosal surfaces.
The genera that comprise the LAB are at its core Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus, as well as the more peripheral Aerococcus, Carnobacterium, Enterococcus, Oenococcus, Sporolactobacillus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus, and Weissella.
Heartwater, Cowdria ruminantium, is an infectious rickettsial disease of domestic and wild ruminants, spread by ticks in the genus Amblyomma.

Heparan sulfate is a derived disaccharide that accumulates in lysosomes, extracellular matrix, and body fluids of people with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs).
MPSs are rare disorders caused by a deficiency of enzymes that break down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).
Symptoms of MPS vary due to which storage product accumulates and the level of enzymatic function or concentration that remains.
Symptoms include musculoskeletal, airway, cardiac, and central nervous system disorders.
Treatments include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the more critical forms of MPS and intravenous enzyme replacement therapy for the others.
Treatment is most effective when it is initiated before irreversible tissue damage has occurred.
Because MPS is so rare and the symptoms so variable, it is difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages.
A solution to that problem is the development of newborn screening assays that can detect heparan sulfate, though the levels in the dried blood spot samples do not appear to predict the severity of disease.
The pattern of dermatan and heparan sulfate can help distinguish between the different MPSs.
Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid nutrient found in fish, green leafy vegetables, soybeans and rice, and is essential for the normal functioning of neuronal cell membranes.

Cefpodoxime is a third generation beta-lactam antibiotic that belongs to the cephalosporin Family of antibiotics.
Its mode of action is to bind to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) that are located on the outer membrane of the bacterium.
When cefpodoxime binds to the PBPs, it interferes with the activity of transpeptidase enzymes which prevents the formation of peptidoglycan chains.
Without the peptidoglycan chains, the bacterial septum and cell wall cannot be produced during cell division, which in turn affects the rigidity of the cell wall and leads to cell lysis.
Cefpodoxime is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and is used to treat acute tuberculosis, otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis.
The HPS1 gene (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 1) is located on chromosome 10q23.1-q23.3.
This gene encodes a protein that may play a role in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes.
The encoded protein is a component of three different protein complexes termed biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC)-3, BLOC4, and BLOC5.
Mutations in this gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1.
Multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene; the full-length sequences of some of these have not been determined yet.

Carrageenan is a vegetarian and vegan alternative to gelatin.
Metyrosine is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug.
It is an inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and consequently of the synthesis of catecholamines.
It is used to control the symptoms of excessive sympathetic stimulation in patients with pheochromocytoma.
(Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed)Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first transformation in catecholamine biosynthesis, i.e., the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA).
Because the first step is also the rate-limiting step, blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase activity results in decreased endogenous levels of catecholamines and their synthesis.
This consequently, depletes the levels of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body,usually measured as decreased urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites.
One main end result of the catecholamine depletion is a decrease in blood presure.
Presence of specific IgE antibodies to Cor a 8 is a risk marker for potential severe reactions in patients with a suspected allergy to hazelnut.
Among hazelnut-allergic individuals in the south of Europe, the predominant sensitization is to the lipid transfer protein Cor a 8.
Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is a respiratory infection that occurs in turkeys and other birds.
Clinical symptoms associated with ORT infections include tracheitis, airsacculitis, sinusitis, pericarditis and exudative pneumonia.
Affected birds show signs of depression and ruffled feathers, reduced feed intake, and decreased egg production.
The severity of the disease is worsened when other respiratory infections coexist.
Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative, Gram-positive bacterium and a component of normal human skin flora.
However, since the 1990s, this organism has been increasingly implicated in a wide range of severe infections, including osteoarticular infections, bacteremia, foreign body infections, and endocarditis.
This information, taken together with its proven ability to produce a number of virulence factors, places S. lugdunensis in the category of emerging pathogen.
Unlike many fellow coagulase-negative staphylococci, it is susceptible to a wide range of antimicrobials .

Transmission occurs through sandflies and the primary vector is Phlebotomus papatasi.
Sandfly fever Naples virus and Sandfly fever Sicilian virus infections share symptoms and clinical similarity.
Symptoms often present as a three day fever with abrupt onset, headache, muscular pain, photophobia, and nausea .
Calcium is the most plentiful mineral in the human body.
Ninety-nine percent is stored in the bones and teeth where it provides structure and functionality.
The remaining 1% of the body's calcium is necessary for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling, and hormonal secretion.
Serum calcium levels do not fluctuate in response to dietary intake.
Bone tissue is the reservoir for calcium and helps to maintain concentrations in the blood, the muscle, and intercellular fluids.
As humans age, the bone is constantly being laid down and reabsorbed.
In growing children, bone formation exceeds that of bone resorption.
In young and middle-aged adults, the bone formation and resorption is about equal.
In older adults, especially in post-menopausal women, bone loss exceeds that of bone formation, which is why their risk for osteoporosis continues to increase as they age.
The ARX gene (aristaless related homeobox) is located on chromosome Xp21.3.
This gene is a homeobox-containing gene expressed during development.
The expressed protein contains two conserved domains, a C-peptide (or aristaless domain) and the prd-like class homeobox domain.
It is a member of the group-II aristaless-related protein family whose members are expressed primarily in the central and/or peripheral nervous system.
This gene is thought to be involved in CNS development.
Mutations in this gene cause X-linked mental retardation and epilepsy.
Haloperidol is a dopamine antagonist of the typical antipsychotic class of medications.
It is a butyrophenone derivative and has pharmacological effects similar to the phenothiazines.
Haloperidol is an older antipsychotic used in the treatment of schizophrenia and acute psychotic states and delirium.
A long-acting decanoate ester is used as an injection given every four weeks to people with schizophrenia or related illnesses who have poor adherence to medication regimens and suffer frequent relapses of illness, or to overcome the drawbacks inherent to its orally administered counterpart that burst dosage increases risk or intensity of side effects.
In some countries, injections of antipsychotics such as haloperidol can be ordered by a court at the request of a psychiatrist.

Along with TCPy, it has been shown to decrease testosterone levels in adult men.
Megakaryopoiesis is the process by which bone marrow progenitor cells (hematopoietic stem cells, HSC) develop into mature megakaryocytes (MKs).
MKs then produce platelets, a process called thrombopoesis.
MKs play a role in the pathogenesis of acute megakaryocytic leukaemia and a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.
Abnormal megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis can lead to morbidity and mortality from bleeding due to moderate to severe thrombocytopenia.

The flowers are pendant, violet, and two inches across.
Heat-stable enterotoxins are proteins secreted by some bacteria including Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholera and others that cause secretory diarrhea.
These enterotoxins are composed of 17-53 amino acids that share a conserved C-terminal region.
They also have three disulfide bonds that give them heat stability and biological activity.
After a series of reactions, the enterotoxins lead to the phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which cause the production of Cl-, HCO3-, and water secretion, resulting in diarrhea.
Fennel is native to southern Europe (where it has been popular since Mycenean times), and is common there and in Britain, Ethiopia, the Middle East, the Far East, the Caribbean and parts of South America.

Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Additional transcript variants have been described but their biological validity has not been confirmed.
The cashew is in the family Anacardiaceae.
Its English name derives from the Portuguese name for the fruit of the cashew tree, caju, which in turn derives from the indigenous Tupi name, acajÃº.
It is now widely grown in tropical climates for its cashew nuts and cashew apples.
Diffusing capacity (DLCO) is the carbon monoxide uptake from a single inspiration in a standard time (usually 10 sec).
Since air consists of very minute or trace quantities of carbon monoxide (CO), 10 seconds is considered to be the standard time for inhalation, then rapidly blow it out (exhale).
The exhaled gas is tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath.
This will pick up diffusion impairments, for instance in pulmonary fibrosis.
This must be corrected for anemia (because rapid CO diffusion is dependent on hemoglobin in RBC's; a low hemoglobin concentration, anemia, will reduce DLCO) and pulmonary hemorrhage (excess RBC's in the interstitium or alveoli can absorb CO and artificially increase the DLCO capacity).
Atmospheric pressure and/or altitude will also affect measured DLCO, and so a correction factor is needed to adjust for standard pressure.
Online calculators are available to correct for hemoglobin levels and altitude and/or pressure where the measurement was taken.
Agaricus is a large and important genus of mushrooms containing both edible and poisonous species, with possibly over 300 members worldwide.
The genus includes the common ("button") mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and the field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), the dominant cultivated mushrooms of the West.
Members of Agaricus are characterized by having a fleshy cap or pileus, from the underside of which grow a number of radiating plates or gills on which are produced the naked spores.
They are distinguished from other members of their family, Agaricaceae, by their chocolate-brown spores.
Members of Agaricus also have a stem or stipe, which elevates the pileus above the object on which the mushroom grows, or substrate, and a partial veil, which protects the developing gills and later forms a ring or annulus on the stalk.
Sibutramine, usually available as sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity, as an appetite suppressant.
Azelaic acid (AZA) is a naturally occurring saturated nine-carbon dicarboxylic acid (COOH (CH2)7-COOH).
It possesses a variety of biological actions both in vitro and in vivo.
Interest in the biological activity of AZA arose originally out of studies of skin surface lipids and the pathogenesis of hypochromia in pityriasis versicolor infection.
Later, it was shown that Pityrosporum can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to C8-C12 dicarboxylic acids that are cornpetitive inhibitors of tyrosinase in vitro.
Azelaic acid was chosen for further investigation and development of a new topical drug for treating hyperpigmentary disorders for the following reasons: it possesses a middle-range of antityrosinase activity, is inexpensive, and more soluble to be incorporated into a base cream than other dicarboxylic acids.
Azelaic acid is another option for the topical treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.
It offers effectiveness similar to that of other agents without the systemic side effects of oral antibiotics or the allergic sensitization of topical benzoyl peroxide and with less irritation than tretinoin.
Azelaic acid is less expensive than certain other prescription acne preparations, but it is much more expensive than nonprescription benzoyl peroxide preparations.
Whether it is safe and effective when used in combination with other agents is not known.
Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ERBB4 gene.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with cancer.
Other single-nucleotide polymorphisms and a risk haplotype have been linked to schizophrenia.
A schistocyte or schizocyte is a fragmented part of a red blood cell (RBC).
Schistocytes are typically irregularly shaped, jagged, and asymmetrical.
A true schistocyte does not have central pallor.
Several microangiopathic diseases, including disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies, generate fibrin strands that sever RBC as they try to move past a thrombus, creating schistocytes.
Schistocytes are often seen in patients with hemolytic anemia and they frequently result from mechanical heart valve prostheses.
Excessive schistocytes present in blood can be a sign of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) where the most common cause is aortic stenosis.
Prolylhydroxyproline is a dipeptide.
Prolylhydroxyproline is a marker of bone collagen degradation, showing high sensitivity for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Prolylhydroxyproline has been suggested as a possible alternative to hydroxyproline determination in bone resorption studies.
Prolylhydroxyproline is one of the iminodipeptides present in the urine of patients with prolidase deficiency.
Prolidase (X-Pro dipeptidase EC 3.4. 13.9) splits iminodipeptides containing C-terminal proline or hydroxyproline (X-Pro or X-Hyp) to X+Pro or X+Hyp.
Prolidase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by chronic ulcerative dermatitis and mental retardation.
These patients excrete large amounts of iminodipeptides containing C-terminal proline in the urine due to hereditary prolidase deficiency.
Ethoheptazine (trade name Zactane) is an opioid analgesic from the phenazepine family and is related to other drugs such as proheptazine.
Ethoheptazine produces similar effects to other opioids, including analgesia, sedation, dizziness and nausea.

Isobutyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (isobutyrylglycinuria; IBG) is an inherited disorder characterized by inadequate levels of an enzyme that helps break down the amino acid valine.
Signs and symptoms of this disorder may not appear until late infancy or childhood and can include failure to thrive, dilated cardiomyopathy, seizures, anemia, and very low blood levels of carnitine.
This condition may be worsened by periods of fasting or infections that increase the body's demand for energy.
Isobutyrylglycinuria is caused by mutations in the ACAD8 gene and has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
Chlorinated solvents are a large family of chemical compounds that contain chlorine, for example, carbon tetrachloride (carbon tet), trichloroethylene (TCE), or methylene chloride.
They are used for a wide variety of commercial and industrial purposes, including degreasers, cleaning solutions, paint thinners, pesticides, resins, glues, and a host of other mixing and thinning solutions.
Their chlorine-containing chemical structure helps them: to efficiently dissolve organic materials like fats and greases and to serve as raw materials or intermediates in the production of other chemicals.
Workers can be exposed to chlorinated solvents through the absorption of solvents, through inhalation and skin contact.
Inhalation is the most common form of workplace exposure, because the solvents can readily evaporate.
Skin contact is another important route of exposure in the workplace.
Benzopyrene, C20H12, is a five-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon whose metabolites are mutagenic and highly carcinogenic.
It belongs to a class of polycyclic aromatic compounds known as benzopyrenes, which consist of a benzene ring fused to a pyrene molecule.
Benzopyrene is a product of incomplete combustion at temperatures between 300 and 600 Â°C.

The a-wave is an electroretinographic measurement of the initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers.
This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to closure of sodium ion channels in the outer-segment membrane.
Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein, which leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) and eventually to a reduction in the level of cGMP within the photoreceptor.
Reduction in cGMP leads to closure of the sodium ion channels, which results in a decrease of inwardly directed sodium ions, or hyperpolarization of the cell.
The a-wave amplitude is measured from baseline to the trough of the a-wave.
Recoverin is a calcium-binding photoreceptor protein that has been identified as the target of autoantibodies that results in cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR).
CAR is a paraneoplastic syndrome where autoantibodies against an unknown neoplasm cross-react with retinal photoreceptor antigens and damage them leading to vision loss.
Only 65% of patients with CAR have detectable antiretinal antibodies and antibodies specific to recoverin are found in approximately 10% of those patients.
Most tumors associated with CAR include small-cell lung cancer and gynecological malignancies.
Neoplasms that are less often associated with CAR include bladder, prostate, pancreatic, small bowel, thymus, thyroid and colon.
Recoverin antibodies lead to cancer-associated retinopathy and have been shown to induce apoptotic death to photoreceptor cells.

Heroin, diamorphine (BAN) or diacetylmorphine (INN) is a semi-synthetic opioid.
It is the 3,6-diacetyl derivative of morphine (hence diacetylmorphine) and is synthesised from it by acetylation.
The white crystalline form is commonly the hydrochloride salt, diacetylmorphine hydrochloride.
It has a high addiction potential, and frequent repeated administration causes a fast development of tolerance to it when compared to other substances, although occasional use without symptoms of withdrawal is also possible.
Internationally, Heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
It is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell heroin in the United States ; however, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.
Popular street names for heroin include chiva, diesel, smack, bag, skag, heron, black tar, horse, junk, jenny, brown, brown sugar, dark, Dope, and H.

Bleeding times are prolonged in aspirin sensitivity, Glazmann's and vonWillebrand's disease.
Reticulated platelets (RPs) are the youngest circulating platelets and have been shown to reflect thrombopoietic activity in humans.
They are identified by their increased RNA content.
An elevated percentage of RPs is diagnostic of increased marrow platelet production, such as in response to idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
A low percentage of RPs is associated with hypoproliferative causes of thrombocytopenia, including chemotherapy or intrinsic marrow aplasia.
In addition to the circulation percentage of RPs by RNAse-based analysis, the RP maturation index (RP-MI), or immature platelet fraction, further refines the sensitivity of RP detection and may be useful to predict platelet count recovery following chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.

Brachyspira that are weakly heamolytic causing a mild colitis include B. murdochii, B. intermedia, B. aalborgi, and B. alvinipulli in pigs, chickens and humans.
Transmission of Brachyspira sp can occur in several ways including: pigs that have subclinical infection; infection from birds or feral animals that act as potential reservoirs; reduced immunity in a herd; routine diagnostic and control measures are not adhered to; and environmental changes such as a change in diet, co-infections and other stresses that increase norepinephrine levels in the gut that can result in the growth and colonization of some species of Brachyspira.
Diagnoses of Brachyspira species are primarily made using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and/or immune staining.
Bordetella is a genus of small (0.2 - 0.7 Âµm), Gram-negative coccobacilli of the phylum proteobacteria.
Bordetella species, with the exception of B. petrii, are obligate aerobes as well as highly fastidious, or difficult to culture.

B. pertussis and occasionally B. parapertussis cause pertussis or whooping cough in humans, and some B. parapertussis strains can colonise sheep.
B. bronchiseptica rarely infects healthy humans though disease in immunocompromised patients has been reported.
B. bronchiseptica causes several diseases in other mammals, including kennel cough and atrophic rhinitis in dogs and pigs, respectively.
Other members of the genus cause similar diseases in other mammals, and in birds (B. hinzii, B. avium).
Water content of the human body can be divided into several components, including intracellular fluid (ICF, 2/3 of body water) and extracellular fluid (ECF,1/3 of body water).
Extracellular fluid is fluid outside of cells and is further divided into plasma (1/5 of ECF), interstitial fluid (4/5 of ECF), and transcellular fluid (normally ignored in calculations).
Transcelluar fluid is primarily contained in organs, such as the gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal and ocular fluids.
Total body water can be determined using methods such as flowing afterglow mass spectrometry (FA-MS).
Extracellular fluid is measured using tracers, such as 82B2, chloride isotopes, and inulin) that go to the extracelluar space.
Intracellular fluid is estimated by subtracting extracellular fluid from total body water.
It is native to Europe but has been introduced on all continents with temperate zones, and many islands.

Rye grass pollen is a very common inducer of asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis
Collagenases are enzymes that break the peptide bonds in collagen.
They assist in destroying extracellular structures in pathogenesis of bacteria such as Clostridium.
They are an exotoxin (a virulence factor) and help to facilitate the spread of gas gangrene.
They normally target the connective tissue in muscle cells and other body organs.
Collagen, a key component of the animal extracellular matrix, is made through cleavage of pro-collagen by collagenase once it has been secreted from the cell.
This stops large structures from forming inside the cell itself.
Collagenase production can be induced during an immune response, by cytokines that stimulate cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts, and cause indirect tissue damage
The SOS1 gene (son of sevenless homolog 1 (Drosophila)) is located on chromosome 2p21.

It is used medically as an appetite suppressant.
It is approved as an appetite suppressant to help reduce weight in obese patients when used short-term and combined with exercise, diet, and behavioral modification.
It is typically prescribed for individuals who are at increased medical risk because of their weight and works by helping to release certain chemicals in the brain that control appetite.
Carnitine.free is a primary marker for carnitine uptake defect, propionic acidemia, maternal carnitine uptake defect, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency and primary lactic acidemia (various types).
It is also a secondary marker for maternal glutaric acidemia type I.
Thiolases, also known as acetyl-Coenzyme A acetyltransferases (ACAT), are enzymes which convert two units of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl CoA in the mevalonate pathway.
There are two different types of thiolase: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC:2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC:2.3.1.16).
3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I) has a broad chain-length specificity for its substrates and is involved in degradative pathways such as fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase II) is specific for the thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and involved in biosynthetic pathways such as poly beta-hydroxybutyric acid synthesis or steroid biogenesis.
Airway resistance is the resistance or limitation to gas flow in the airway.
Airway resistance can be affected by many variables, including airway diameter, lung elasticity, and gas composition.
C5 plays a central role in both the classical and the alternative pathway of COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION.
C5 is cleaved by C5 CONVERTASE into COMPLEMENT C5A and COMPLEMENT C5B.
The smaller fragment C5a is an ANAPHYLATOXIN and mediator of inflammatory process.
The major fragment C5b binds to the membrane initiating the spontaneous assembly of the late complement components, C5-C9, into the MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX.
A diol is a chemical compound containing two hydroxyl groups (-OH groups).
Vicinal diols have hydroxyl groups bonded to atoms next to each other, i. e. bonded to each other.
Examples of vicinal diol compounds are ethylene glycol and propylene glycol.
Geminal diols have hydroxyl groups bonded to the same atom.
When the atom is a carbon atom in an organic compound, the diol section of the molecule is unstable and has a tendency to dehydrate forming a carbonyl group.
For example, carbonic acid (HO-CO-OH) is unstable and has a tendency to convert to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2 O).
Only when formaldehyde (H-CO-H) is dissolved in water is the chemical equilibrium in favor of the geminal diol version of the compound.
Other examples of diols are 1,4-Butanediol and Bisphenol A. Synthesis of diols:Diols can be produced from the oxidation of alkenes, usually with dilute acidic potassium permanganate .
Sedoheptulose is a ketoheptose, a monosaccharide with seven carbon atoms and a ketone functional group.
Increased levels of sedoheptulose is associated with nephropathic cystinosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the nephropathic cystinosis (CTNS) gene.
Wamelink et al. (2008) found that cystinosis patients with the common 57-kb deletion had increased urinary sedoheptulose and erythritol compared to patients with other CTNS mutations.
There are two different types of dietary fiber -- soluble and insoluble.
Both are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases.
Soluble fiber attracts water and turns to gel during digestion.
Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables.
It is also found in psyllium, a common fiber supplement.
Some types of soluble fiber may help lower risk of heart disease.

It is categorized as a substance of abuse or designer drug.
Synthetic cathinones cause amphetamine-like effects.
They are mainly used for social purposes but are also used for their stimulant properties.
Effects of synthetic cathinones depend on the individual, the dosage of drug administered and the route of administration but the primary effects which make them attractive are increased alertness, sociability, effectiveness in work, euphoria, intense physical and sensory pleasure and a decreased appetite.
The most common adverse effects are cardiac and neurologic.
Cefcapene is a broad spectrum, oral, third-generation cephalosporin with activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
It may be more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) compared to other oral cephalosporin antibiotics.
Mutations in the ACADSB gene cause 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also called 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria or short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SBCADD).
SBCADD is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with symptoms such as lethargy, muscle weakness, developmental delay and epilepsy.
Deficiency in the 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme leads to reduced break down isoleucine and excess amounts of 2-methylbutyrylglycine and related compounds, causing serious health problems.
Mycotoxins are any toxins produced by fungi (molds, yeast, and mushrooms).
Most analyses involve non-mushroom toxin, such as Alflatoxin, Ochratoxin A, patulin, or fusarium, which are contained in crops in various climate zones.
Veterinary Medicine: Ceftiofur is an antibiotic of the cephalosporin type (third generation), licensed for use in veterinary medicine.
It was first described in 1987.
It is marketed by pharmaceutical company Pfizer as Excede.
It is resistant to the antibiotic resistance enzyme beta-lactamase, and has activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
E. coli strains resistant to ceftiofur have been reported.
The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) was originally published as a marker of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C. More recently, it has also been studied in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
The APRI is calculated from two common lab results as follows: x100.
For cirrhosis, a score of greater than 2 is considered positive while patients with a score of less than 1 are considered unlikely to have cirrhosis.
For significant fibrosis, 1.5 is used as the threshold for identifying significant fibrosis, and less than 0.5 rules it out.
Other indirect indicators of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis include the FIB-4, which is based on AST, ALT, platelet count, and patient age, and the Forns index, which uses GGT, cholesterol, platelet count, and patient age.
Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation and is converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase (xanthine dehydrogenase) enzyme.
Some people lack sufficient xanthine oxidase, and thus xanthine cannot be converted to uric acid.
This rare genetic disorder is called xanthinuria results from excessive excretion of xanthine into the urine.
This disorder can result in urolithiasis and sometimes myopathy from xanthine deposition.
Elevated xanthine can also result from allopurinol treatment.
Xanthine is also the core chemical component of a group of alkaloids that are commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in treating the symptoms of asthma.
Their effects, however, are widespread and their therapeutic range is narrow and so they are not the drug of choice in asthma treatment.
Methylated xanthine derivatives include caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine (found mainly in chocolate).
These drugs inhibit phosphodiesterase and antagonise adenoine.
Hydroxybupropion, also known as 6-hydroxybupropion and BW 306U, is the major active metabolite of the antidepressant and smoking cessation drug bupropion.
It is formed from bupropion by the enzyme CYP2B6.
With oral bupropion treatment, hydroxybupropion is present in plasma at area under the curve concentrations that are as many as 16 times greater than those of bupropion itself, demonstrating extensive first-pass metabolism of bupropion into hydroxybupropion in humans.
As such, hydroxybupropion is likely to play a very important role in the effects of oral bupropion, which could be accurately thought of as functioning in large part as a prodrug to hydroxybupropion.

Crotoxyphos is a light straw colored liquid and an organophosphate insecticide that is lethal to insects that ingest or come in contact with it.
It is used on lactating dairy and beef cattle, swine, goats, horses, and sheep to combat flies, lice and ticks.
Like all organophosphates, crotoxyphos is extremely poisonous if inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or ingested.
Symptoms of exposure include weakness, incoordination, muscle twitching, tremor, nausea, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, sweating.
Extreme exposure can lead to blurred or dark vision, confusion, tightness in the chest, wheezing, productive cough, pulmonary edema, incontinence, unconsciousness, and convulsions.
Slowing of the heart rate may result in complete cardiac arrest.
Crotoxyphos is only slightly toxic to birds, fish and beneficial insects.
Crotoxyphos has been used to treat human lice.
Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) also known as aromatic esterase 1 or serum aryldialkylphosphatase 1 is an enzyme encoded by the PON1 gene.
The PON1 enzyme is a major anti-atherosclerotic component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and may protect against LDL oxidation.
Diminished levels have been linked to heightened systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.
The PON1 enzyme also is responsible for hydrolysing organophosphate pesticides and nerve gasses.
PON1 activity is low in infants compared to adults.

The thymol turbidity test indirectly measures globulin concentration by mixing a part blood with 60 parts of a supersaturated thymol solution and measuring the resulting turbidity.
High levels of turbidity are indicative of disorders such as acute viral hepatitis and cirrhosis.
Turbidity value of less than 5 is considered in normal range, 6-12 is considered the "cirrhosis" range, and values of 12-30 are seen in the acute phase of viral hepatitis.
The SRSF2 gene (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) is located on chromosome 17q25.1.
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich family of pre-mRNA splicing factors, which constitute part of the spliceosome.
Each of these factors contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) for binding RNA and an RS domain for binding other proteins.
The RS domain is rich in serine and arginine residues and facilitates interaction between different SR splicing factors.
In addition to being critical for mRNA splicing, the SR proteins have also been shown to be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus and in translation.
Two transcript variants encoding the same protein and one non-coding transcript variant have been found for this gene.
In addition, a pseudogene of this gene has been found on chromosome 11.
The PEX7 gene (peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7) is located on chromosome 6q23.3.
This gene encodes the cytosolic receptor for the set of peroxisomal matrix enzymes targeted to the organelle by the peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2).
Defects in this gene cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), which are characterized by multiple defects in peroxisome function.
There are at least 14 complementation groups for PBDs, with more than one phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups.
Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle.
Defects in this gene have been associated with PBD complementation group 11 (PBD-CG11) disorders, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1), and Refsum disease (RD).

Potential targets when testing for PRCV RNA include a region of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and the spike (S) gene.
Saquinavir is an antiretroviral drug used in HIV therapy.
It falls in the protease inhibitor class.
The AXIN2 gene (axin 2) is located on chromosome 17q24.1.
The Axin-related protein, Axin2, presumably plays an important role in the regulation of the stability of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway, like its rodent homologs, mouse conductin/rat axil.
In mouse, conductin organizes a multiprotein complex of APC (adenomatous polyposis of the colon), beta-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta, and conductin, which leads to the degradation of beta-catenin.
Apparently, the deregulation of beta-catenin is an important event in the genesis of a number of malignancies.
The AXIN2 gene has been mapped to 17q23-q24, a region that shows frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and other tumors.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with colorectal cancer with defective mismatch repair.

Its binding to plasma albumin is weaker than alprenolol and it may be useful in angina pectoris, hypertension, or cardiac arrhythmias.
The only North American producer, Monsanto Company, marketed chemical mixtures of PCBs under the trade name Aroclor from 1930 to 1977.
The PCBs mixtures were made up of a variety of individual chlorinated biphenyl components, known as congeners (e.g. 2,2',5-Trichlorobiphenyl).
The chemical mixtures were sold under trade names followed by a 4 digit number.
The first two digits generally refer to the number of carbon atoms in the biphenyl skeleton (for PCBs this is 12), the second two numbers indicate the percentage of chlorine by mass in the mixture.
Thus, Aroclor 1260 has 12 carbon atoms and contains 60% chlorine by mass.
An exception is Aroclor 1016, which also has 12 carbon atoms, but has 42% chlorine by mass.
Different Aroclors were used at different times and for different applications.
In electrical equipment manufacturing in the USA, Aroclor 1260 and Aroclor 1254 were the main mixtures used before 1950, Aroclor 1242 was the main mixture used in the 1950s and 1960s until it was phased out in 1971 and replaced by Aroclor 1016.
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement and a prescription medication.
Vitamin B12 exists in several forms and contains the mineral cobalt, so compounds with vitamin B12 activity are collectively called "cobalamins".
Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the forms of vitamin B12 that are active in human metabolism.
Vitamin B12 is required for proper red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis.
Vitamin B12, bound to protein in food, is released by the activity of hydrochloric acid and gastric protease in the stomach.
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that affects the gastric mucosa and results in gastric atrophy.
This leads to the destruction of parietal cells, achlorhydria, and failure to produce intrinsic factor, resulting in vitamin B12 malabsorption.
If pernicious anemia is left untreated, it causes vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to megaloblastic anemia and neurologic disorders.
Vitamin B12 is naturally found in animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products.
Vitamin B12 is generally not present in plant foods, but fortified breakfast cereals are a source of vitamin B12 with high bioavailability for vegetarians.

The PKHD1 gene (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (autosomal recessive)) is located on chromosome 6p12.2.
The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to have a single transmembrane (TM)-spanning domain and multiple copies of an immunoglobulin-like plexin-transcription-factor domain.
Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
Other alternatively spliced transcripts have been described, but the full length sequences have not been determined.
Several of these transcripts are predicted to encode truncated products which lack the TM and may be secreted.
Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, also known as polycystic kidney and hepatic disease-1.
MART-1 / Melan-A is a protein antigen found on melanocytes.
Antibodies against the antigen are used in the medical specialty of anatomic pathology in order to recognize cells of melanocytic differentiation, useful for the diagnosis of a melanoma.
The same name is also used to refer to the gene which codes for the antigen.
The MART-1 / Melan-A antigen is specific for the melanocyte lineage, found in normal skin, the retina, and melanocytes, but not in other normal tissues.
It is thus useful as a marker for melanocytic tumors (melanomas) with the caveat that it is normally found in benign nevi as well.
The BCL2 gene (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2) is located on chromosome 18q21.3.

Eicosapentaenoate (EPA) is a long chain omega-3 fatty acid that is present throughout the body including in cell membranes.
EPA is found in fatty fish including salmon, tuna, mackerel, sardines, shellfish, and herring.
EPA can be biosynthesized from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), but it is much more efficient to increase levels by including EPA-rich sources in one's diet.
EPA has anti-inflammatory properties that are vital to fetal development and the process of healthy aging.
Its anti-inflammatory effects are due to reduced gene expression of genes involved in inflammatory and atherogenesis-related pathways, thereby lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.
EPA has also been found to increase platelet stability, decrease endothelial activation, and improve vascular permeability.
Taking EPA supplements leads to an increased amount of EPA in the plaque of carotid arteries which may decrease inflammation and increase plaque stability.
Many other studies have been run that show acorrelation between higher plasma levels of EPA and reduced symptoms of disease, some of which include Alzheimer's disease, depression, rheumatoid arthritis, and Raynaud Syndrome.
Burkholderia mallei is a gram-negative bipolar aerobic bacterium, a Burkholderia-genus human and animal pathogen causing Glanders; the Latin name of this disease (malleus) gave name to the causative agent species.
It is closely related to B. pseudomalle....
Human infection with B. mallei is rare, although it occasionally occurs among lab workers dealing with the bacteria or those who are frequently near infected animals.
The bacteria usually infect a person through their eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts in the skin.
Once a person is infected with the bacteria, they develop a fever and rigors.
Eventually they will get pneumonia, pustules, and abscesses, which will prove fatal within a week to ten days if left untreated by antibiotics.
Antibodies to Coccidioides F antigen appear within a month of infection, and remain detectable for up to a year thereafter.

Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome or Hb Lepore syndrome (Hb Lepore) is typically an asymptomatic hemoglobinopathy, which is caused by an autosomal recessive genetic mutation.
The Hb Lepore variant, consisting of two normal alpha globin chains (HBA) and two deltabeta globin fusion chains which occurs due to a "crossover" between the delta (HBD) and beta globin (HBB) gene loci during meiosis.
The homozygous state for Hb Lepore is rare.
Patients of Balkan descent tend to have the most severe presentation of symptoms including severe anemia during the first five years of life.
They also presented with significant splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities identical to those of homozygous beta-thalassemia.
The amount of Hb Lepore in the patients blood ranged from 8 to 30 %, the remainder being fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) which is present in minute quantities (typically<1 percent) in the red blood cells of adults.
Known as F- cells they are present in a small proportion of overall RBCs.
Heterozygous Hb Lepore is similar to beta-thalassemia major, however the clinical course is variable.
Patients with this condition typically present with severe anemia during the first two years of life.
The heterozygote form is mildly anemic (Hb 11-13 g/dl) but presents with a significant hypochromia (deficiency of hemoglobin in the red blood cells) and microcytosis.
The SOD1 gene (superoxide dismutase 1, soluble) is located on chromosome 21q22.11.
The protein encoded by this gene binds copper and zinc ions and is one of two isozymes responsible for destroying free superoxide radicals in the body.

Western ragweed is found across most of North America, including northern Mexico.
Its range is extensive but its incidence is only significant in the Great Plains and Great Basin in the US.
It is also common in Australia and Mauritania.
Western ragweed Code: w2 Latin name: Ambrosia psilostachya Source material: Pollen Family: Asteraceae (Compositae) Common names: Western ragweed, Perennial ragweed Allergen Exposure Geographical distribution Western ragweed is found across most of North America, including northern Mexico.
Its range is extensive but its incidence is only significant in the Great Plains and Great Basin in the US.
It is also common in Australia and Mauritania.
Western ragweed is an erect, coarse herbaceous perennial with a creeping rootstock.
The leaves are soft, green and opposite or alternate.
The leaves are deeply pinnately lobed, hairy, and with irregularly toothed margins.
Its foliage is similar to that of False ragweed, but its burs are shaped like those of Giant ragweed.
Unlike Ragweed and Giant ragweed, Western ragweed can reproduce vegetatively from creeping roots (rhizomes), which often gives it a straight-line pattern across lawns and waste areas.
Western ragweed flowers from July to November.
It is wind-pollinated, releasing millions of pollen grains into the air.
However, the presence of the pollen in honey indicates some insect pollination.
The plant is monoecious (male and female organs are separate, but occur on the same plant), with the staminate (pollen-producing) heads at the leafless tips of the branches, and the single-flowered pistillate (seed-producing) heads clustered lower down.
The fruits are small burs, with the involucre, sometimes slightly spiny or beaked, enclosing the fruit.
Western ragweed is not as large or as abundant as the Ragweed of the more eastern parts of the continent, and is therefore less of an allergy problem.
Environment Western ragweed occurs on plains, dry fields, meadows and prairies, but also along roadsides and in waste places.
It spreads rapidly and becomes a pest, especially when it invades cultivated lands and pastures.
If dairy cows eat it, their milk becomes bitter.
Unexpected exposure The leaves of the plant are used in herbal medications.
A tea made from the roots is used as a herbal remedy.
The pollen is harvested commercially and manufactured into homeopathic preparations for the treatment of allergies to the plant.
Allergens The following allergen have been characterised: Amb p 5 has been characterised (1-3).
Ragweed pollen contains a profilin, though this allergen has not been characterised (4-5).
Potential cross-reactivity With the use of a serum pool from patients sensitive to Short ragweed, the cross-reactivity of IgE antibodies to six Ragweeds was studied through the radioallergosorbent test.
Extracts were analysed for their inhibitory activities, with solid-phase allergens prepared from all of the Ragweed pollens.
Also, samples of serum were absorbed with the various solid-phase allergens and the reactivity of the remaining IgE antibodies was determined.
Two patterns of reactivity were observed.
Short, Giant, Western, and False ragweeds displayed comparable reactivity in both inhibition and absorption experiments.
Slender and Southern ragweed were considerably less active, indicating that they lacked allergenic groupings possessed by the other species.
These same patterns of cross-reactivity were found using Ragweed pollens from four commercial sources (6).
Further cross-reactivity among the various Ragweeds can be inferred due to the high cross-reactivity among various other members of the genus Ambrosia and of the family Asteraceae.
For example, cross-reactivity among Chamomile tea extract, pollen of Matricaria chamomilla, A. vulgaris (Mugwort), and A. trifida (Giant ragweed) was demonstrated by an ELISA-inhibition study (7).
Further evidence confirming cross-reactivity among members of the Ragweed genus was obtained in a study using a fluorescent allergosorbent test, in which similar antigenic determinants were found among Short and Giant ragweed, Cocklebur, Lamb's quarters, Rough pigweed, Marshelder, and Goldenrod.
Cocklebur and Giant ragweed were highly potent in their ability to competitively bind to Short ragweed IgE.
The other pollens demonstrated lower potency of cross-reacting antigens (8).
Also, a water-insoluble material, extracted from Short ragweed and False ragweed pollen, contained at least five proteins.
Two (RFA2 and RFB2) were isolated and shown to possess antigenicity as well as allergenicity.
Immunodiffusion tests of RFB2, isolated from False ragweed and Short ragweed, showed immunological identity (9).
Considering the close cross-reactivity described above, the following further possibilities should be considered.
Mugwort, Ragweed, and Timothy grass pollen share IgE epitopes with Latex glycoprotein allergens.
The presence of common epitopes might in part explain clinical symptoms on contact with Latex in patients allergic to pollen.
In this study, any previously known panallergen was not detected (10).
An association between Ragweed pollinosis and hypersensitivity to Cucurbitaceae vegetables (e.g., Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Honeydew Melon, Zucchini, and Cucumber) and Banana has been reported.
Up to now three allergens have been identified as candidates for causing this cross-reactivity: profilin, Bet v 1, and a 60-69 kDa allergen (11).
Further evidence for cross-reactivity between Cucurbitaceae and Ragweed was found in a study that reported that of the sera of 192 allergic patients, 63% contained anti-Ragweed IgE, and among these patients, 28% to 50% had sera containing IgE specific for any single gourd family member.
The extracts of Watermelon and Ragweed inhibited each other in a dose-dependent manner (12).
Ragweed profilin can be expected to result in cross-reactivity between this plant and other plants containing profilin.
This has been demonstrated between Ragweed and Persimmon (5).
In a second study, 35 of 36 patients' sera containing IgE to Ragweed profilin reacted with profilin from Latex, indicating structural homologies between profilin from Latex and Ragweed.
Because profilin is also present in Banana extract, it is likely to be involved in cross-sensitivity between Banana and Latex (4).
In addition to profilin, Mugwort and Ragweed pollen contain a number of other cross-reactive allergens, among them the major Mugwort allergen Art v 1.
These cross-reactive IgE antibodies could result in clinically significant allergic reactions (13).
Evidence of further cross-reactivity between Mugwort and other members of the Asteraceae family (of which Ragweed is a member) consists in the high degree of in vivo cross-reactivity between Matricaria chamomilla (Camomile) and Mugwort (14).
Cross-reactivity between Sunflower and other Asteraceae pollens (Mugwort, Marguerite, Dandelion, Goldenrod, and Short ragweed) has also been demonstrated by RAST and immunoblotting inhibition experiments.
Mugwort pollen exhibited the greatest degree of cross-reactivity with Sunflower pollen, whereas at the other end of the spectrum, Short ragweed showed fewer cross-reactive epitopes (15).
Celery cross-reacting with Ragweed has also been reported, but a panallergen was not identified in these studies (16-17).
Binding to IgE from Ginkgo pollen proteins (Ginkgo biloba L.) was shown to be almost completely inhibited by Oak, Ryegrass, Mugwort and Ragweed, but only partially by Japanese Hop and rBet v 2 from Birch tree pollen (18).
A panallergen may be indicated but was not isolated.
Sera from subjects allergic to White Cypress Pine, Italian cypress, Ryegrass or Birch pollen were shown to have IgE antibodies that reacted with pollens from these four species and from Cocksfoot, Couch grass, Lamb's quarters, Wall pellitory, Olive, Plantain and Ragweed.
The authors concluded that the presence of pollen-reactive IgE antibodies may not necessarily be a true reflection of sensitising pollen species (19).
The Japanese Cypress tree pollen allergen, Cha o 1, has a 46 to 49% similarly to the major allergens of Short ragweed, Amb a 1 and Amb a 2 (20).
A panallergen has been identified in Birch pollen, Ragweed pollen, Timothy grass pollen, Celery, Carrot, Apple, Peanut, Paprika, Anise, Fennel, Coriander and Cumin.
EAST inhibition and immunoblot inhibition demonstrated that cross-reactions between Mango fruits, Mugwort pollen, Birch pollen, Celery, and Carrot are based on allergens related to Bet v 1 and Art v 1, the major allergens of Birch and Mugwort pollen, respectively (21).
Pollen of Artemisia annua is considered to be one of the most important allergens in autumnal hay fever in China, just as Ragweed is in North America.
Extracts of pollen-free Artemisia annua components were found to contain similar allergens to those of Ragweed pollen.
In 52 subjects sensitive to Artemisia pollen, 92.3% were shown on skin prick testing to have IgE antibodies to this allergen, 100% gave positive responses in intradermal tests, 66.7% gave positive responses in intranasal challenges, and 59.3% gave positive responses in bronchial provocation tests (22).
Ragweed pollen appears to also be cross-reactive with pollen from Yellow dock (Rumex crispus).
When monoclonal antibodies with different specificity were applied against the major allergenic components of Ragweed pollen, the monoclonal antibodies reacted with antigens of Yellow dock pollen.
In a preliminary study, sera of 2 patients containing IgE antibodies to Ragweed pollen antigens also reacted to the 40K component of Yellow dock pollen.
In specific IgE tests on 109 patients with bronchial asthma, 22 had a positive reaction to a crude extract of Ragweed pollen, and 18 also reacted to a crude extract of Yellow dock pollen (23).
Ragweed, and in particular Short ragweed (A. artemisiifolia), is clinically the most important source of seasonal aeroallergens, as it is responsible for both the majority of cases and the most severe cases of allergic rhinitis.

CD158b is also a useful marker in the evaluation of kidney transplant rejection.
The Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area (PISA) method is based on convergent flow dynamics and the Continuity Principle.
Proximal to the orifice, flow converges in hemispheric layers of equal velocity.
The flow rate across any of these hemispherical isovelocity surfaces is equal to the area of the surface (which can be calculated from its radius) multiplied by the flow velocity at the surface.
Choosing a PISA velocity equal to the aliasing velocity of the system is an easy way to visualize an isovelocity surface (which will appear as the surface where the Doppler color switches between red and blue) and measure the corresponding PISA radius from the center of the orifice to the surface.
The Continuity Principle states that in the absence of a leak or additional flow into a conduit, the flow rate will be constant along the length of the conduit, whether the conduit is the heart or the regurgitant jet.
So the flow rate through the regurgitant orifice is the same as the flow rate across the PISA surface.
Dividing the flow rate by the peak velocity through the orifice (measured using continuous wave Doppler of the regurgitant jet) provides the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA).

The main pathogenic species of Brucella are Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis and Brucella abortus.
Brucella melitensis is a gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium from the Brucellaceae family.
It mainly affects the reproductive tract of goats and sheep, and in some regions is the major cause of abortion in them.
It can also negatively impact fertility and lactation over time.
B. melitensis has the broadest host range, infecting cattle, camels and dogs, in addition to sheep, goats and humans.

Other impacts of the disease are sterility, posterior paralysis and spondylitis.
It is transmitted mainly by ingestion of infected tissues or fluids.
It can cause undulant fever.
B. suis are gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacilli and can specifically produce in phagocytic cells.
They are also non-spore-forming, non-capsulated, and non-motile.
Brucella suis are differentiated into five strains.
Strains 1-3 infect boars and pigs.
Strain 2 has been found in wild boars but without signs of infection while they do infect pigs and hares.

Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) is one of the tests used to detect the presence of lupus anticoagulants (LA), which are autoantibodies associated with excess clot formation, excess bleeding, and repeated miscarriages.
The coagulant in the venom directly activates factor X, which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of factor V and phospholipid.
If phospholipid antibodies are present, this reaction will be inhibited, which will prolong the screening dRVVT and suggests the presence of LA.
A positive screening dRVVT result may be followed by a dRVVT mixing study using pooled normal plasma (PNP) from healthy donors as a source of coagulation factors.
If the dRVVT normalizes in the mixing study, a clotting factor deficiency is presumed to be the cause of the clotting abnormality.

Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 19 also known as cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) or keratin-19 (K19) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KRT19 gene.
Due to its high sensitivity, KRT19 is the most used marker for the RT-PCR-mediated detection of tumor cells disseminated in lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow of breast cancer patients.
Depending on the assays, KRT19 has been shown to be both a specific and a non-specific marker.
False positivity in such KRT19 RT-PCR studies include: illegitimate transcription (expression of small amounts of KRT19 mRNA by tissues in which it has no real physiological role), haematological disorders (KRT19 induction in peripheral blood cells by cytokines and growth factors, which circulate at higher concentrations in inflammatory conditions and neutropenia), the presence of pseudogenes (two KRT19 pseudogenes, KRT19a and KRT19b, have been identified, which have significant sequence homology to KRT19 mRNA.
Subsequently, attempts to detect the expression of the authentic KRT19 may result in the detection of either or both of these pseudogenes), sample contamination (introduction of contaminating epithelial cells during peripheral blood sampling for subsequent RT-PCR analysis).
Keratin 19 is often used together with keratin 8 and keratin 18 to differentiate cells of epithelial origin from hematopoietic cells in tests that enumerate circulating tumor cells in blood.

Hemolytic anemia can be caused by red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis.
Alterations in the RBC membrane cause its shape to change from the typical torus, resulting in a lower surface area that makes the cell more fragile when placed in a hypotonic saline solution.
This fragility becomes greater over time, as RBC membrane changes faster than normal.
Osmotic fragility testing evaluates the extent of RBC membrane alteration.
The serum-peritoneal fluid effusion glucose gradient is measured as part a differential diagnosis of exudates and transudates and bacterial peritonitis.

The influenza A virus (FLUAV) is a common respiratory virus that infects humans as well as birds, horses, seals, dogs, and pigs.
There are eight gene segments that make up the negative single-stranded RNA of the FLUAV.
The gene segments are known as PB1, PB2, PA, NP, HA, NA, M, and NS.
Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have high antigenic variation and are the two glycoproteins on the FLUAV surface that designate its subtype.
The subtypes of FLUAV that are currently found within the human population are H1N1 and H3N2.
HA and NA subtypes are preserved in the avian species and comprise the pool of virus from which all mammalian FLUAV are drawn.
Antigenic shift is defined as important antigenic modifications in the HA and/or NA subtype within the human population.
Pigs contribute to these antigenic shifts because their trachea contain receptors to both avian and human influenza viruses.
The avian and human viruses within the pig trachea replicate in close proximity to one another, and are able to exchange genetic material and thereby create new strains of virus.
This plant is native to temperate regions of both Europe and North America.
Technically, Raspberries are those brambles in which the small, knobby, thimble-shaped fruit separates readily from the core or receptacle, unlike the similar-looking Blackberry, of which the fruit is firmly attached to the receptacle.

Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) are gram-negative bacterium usually found in the stomach.
To treat for H.pylori infections, antibiotics such as clarithromycin/metronidazole or clarithromycin/amoxicillin are given.
H.pylori is known to be resistant to clarithromycin due to decreased binding of the antibiotic to the bacterial ribosome.
The insufficient binding is caused by point mutations within the 23S rRNA peptidyl transferase -encoding region.
Three major variants (A2143G, A2142G and A2142C) in two adjacent position on the 23S rRNA gene are most commonly associated with clarithromycin resistance.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a group of progressive conditions (encephalopathies) that affect the brain and nervous system of many animals, including humans.
According to the most widespread hypothesis they are transmitted by abnormal prions, though some other data suggest an involvement of a Spiroplasma infection.
Mental and physical abilities deteriorate and a myriad of tiny holes appear in the cortex causing it to appear like a sponge (hence spongiform) when brain tissue obtained at autopsy is examined under a microscope.
The disorders cause impairment of brain function, including memory changes, personality changes and problems with movement that worsen over time.
Most TSEs are sporadic and occur in animals.
Prion diseases of animals in include classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (C-type), atypical (H or L-type) BSE, Scrapie, atypical scrapie, Nor98, and chronic wasting disease (CWE).
H-type and L-type BSE were named based on abnormal prion bands migrating to a higher (H) or lower (L) position on western blot analysis compared to the classical BSE (C-type) prion protein.
Prion diseases of humans include classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD, a human disorder related to Bovine spongiform encephalopathy), Gerstmann-StrÃ¤ussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia and kuru.
These conditions form a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms.
Mefenorex (Rondimen, Pondinil, Anexate) is a stimulant drug which was used as an appetite suppressant.

Gal d 2, also known as Ovalbumin and Albumin, is a 44 kDa phosphoglycoprotein.
Ovalbumin is a major allergen of Hen's egg white and is the most abundant of Egg white proteins, comprising 54% of the total proteins and a fivefold greater quantity than Ovomucoid.
Ovalbumin was previously considered to be the most important allergen of Egg white.
But its importance was over-estimated due to frequent contamination of commercial preparations with Ovomucoid.
In spite of a difference in the molecular weights of Ovomucoid and Ovalbumin, they cannot be completely separated by some processes, which has lead to the erroneous assumption of cross-reactions.
A thiazide diuretic often considered the prototypical member of this class.

Urine zinc levels are measured to evaluate therapy compliance in patients with Wilson's disease.
Zinc is excreted mainly in feces, but elevated urine zinc levels may suggest excessive zinc supplementation.
Growth retardation, hypogonadism, skin changes, poor appetite, mental lethargy and delayed wound healing are some manifestations of chronic zinc deficiency.
Severe deficiency may be life threatening in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica.
Pentylone is a cathinone derivative, a stimulant that has been identified as a component of the drug mixture, NRG ("energy"), categorized as a designer drug or substance of abuse.
The physiological, neurological, and toxic actions of pentylone have not yet been characterized (2017) but synthetic cathinones cause amphetamine-like effects.
They are mainly used for social purposes but are also used for their stimulant properties as a replacement for illicit drug use.
Effects of synthetic cathinones depend on the individual, the dosage of drug administered and the route of administration but the primary effects which make them attractive are increased alertness, sociability, effectiveness in work, euphoria, intense physical and sensory pleasure and a decreased appetite.
The most common adverse effects are cardiac and neurologic.
Metaxalone (marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Skelaxin) is a muscle relaxant used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions.

The term opiate refers to the alkaloids found in opium, an extract from the seed pods of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.).
It encompasses natural and semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine.
The term is often incorrectly used to refer to all drugs with opium- or morphine-like pharmacological action, which are more properly classified under the broader term opioid.
The main opiates derived from opium are morphine, codeine and thebaine.
Papaverine and noscapine are included, but have essentially no effect on the central nervous system, and are not usually considered to be opioids.
Papaveretum is a standardised preparation of mixed opium alkaloids used on cardiac patients.
Eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) is a fluorescent dye used in flow cytometry to screen for hereditary spherocytosis (HS).
Patients with HS have red blood cells (RBC) that are overly rigid and misshapen and are removed by the spleen for destruction which leads to anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly.
EMA binds covalently to Lys-430 on the first extracellular loop of the Band 3 protein on RBCs.
The cytoplasmic portion of Band 3 communicates with ankyrin and protein 4.2 that are crosslinked with the spectrin-based cytoskeleton that acts to stabilize the cell membrane.
When band 3 is deficient or abnormal on RBCs fluorescence using EMA may be reduced.
The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the patient and control cells is measured and the result is expressed as a ratio of patient MFI to control MFI.MedlinePlus Condition: hereditary-spherocytosis]

The KCNQ1OT1 gene (KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1 (non-protein coding)) is located on chromosome 11p15.
Human chromosomal region 11p15.5 contains two clusters of epigenetically-regulated genes that are expressed from only one chromosome in a parent-of-origin manner.
Each cluster, or imprinted domain, is regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control region (ICR).
The human CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1 domain is regulated by an ICR located in an intron of KCNQ1, and contains at least eight genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially from the maternally-inherited allele.
The DNA of the ICR is specifically methylated on the maternally-inherited chromosome, and unmethylated on the paternally-inherited chromosome.
The ICR contains the promoter of the KCNQ1OT1 gene that is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele.
The KCNQ1OT1 transcript is the antisense to the KCNQ1 gene and is a unspliced long non-coding RNA.
It interacts with chromatin and regulates transcription of multiple target genes through epigenetic modifications.
The transcript is abnormally expressed from both chromosomes in most patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and the transcript also plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Cefazolin, also known as cefazoline or cephazolin, is a antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections and usually administered by either intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion.
As a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefazolin is very active against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria.
The broad spectrum of activity can be contributed to the improved stability to many bacterial beta-lactamases compared to penicillins.
Due to possible cross-reactivity with penicillins, people who have experienced anaphylaxis to penicillins are not advised to receive cephalosporins.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.
Used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved, cefazolin is indicated for use in the following infections: respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin, biliary tract, bone and joint, genital, sepsis, and endocarditis.

True Cinnamon is the dried or powdered inner bark of the Cinnamomum zeylanicum tree and has been used as a spice and in perfume and incense for over 5000 years.
True Cinnamon is a native of Sri Lanka and was a monopoly of that country before sources developed on the neighbouring Malabar Coast of India, and in Myanmar (Burma), South America and the West Indies.
True Cinnamon should be distinguished from the closely related Cassia (Chinese Cinnamon, used in China long before True Cinnamon but now considered an inferior substitute), which is obtained from Cinnamomum cassia, grown in China.
True Cinnamon has been replaced almost entirely by Cassia in many markets and is not often used-nor are consumers often aware of the difference.
Cassia is thicker, darker, more pungent and rougher in appearance, with a less subtle flavour.
It is the main source of Cinnamon oil.
Cinnamon may commonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Carnitine is used to mean total carnitines, because historically total carnitine was measured by heating up the sample and breaking off the esters which provided pure carnitine.
(Carnitine is also a single molecule which is described as free carnitine - with the acronym, C0).
Aclycarnitine is not a single moiety but rather describes all of the esterified carnitines.
So Total carnitine = free carnitine(C0) + acylcarnitine = esterified + unesterified carnitine.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a pathogenic bacterial species in the genus Mycobacterium and the causative agent of most cases of tuberculosis (TB).
M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface (primarily mycolic acid), which makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, so acid-fast detection techniques are used, instead.
The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen.
Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, MTB infects the lungs.
The most frequently used diagnostic methods for TB are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, and chest radiographs
Retinoic acid is the oxidized form of Vitamin A, with only partial vitamin A function.
It functions in determining position along embryonic anterior/posterior axis in chordates.
It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages.
Retinoic acid acts by binding to heterodimers of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR), which then bind to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in the regulatory regions of direct targets (including Hox genes), thereby activating gene transcription.
Retinoic acid receptors mediate transcription of different sets of genes of cell differentiation, thus it also depends on the target cells.
One of the target genes is the gene of the retinoic acid receptor itself, which occurs during positive regulation.
Control of retinoic acid levels is maintained by a suite of proteins.
Retinoic acid can be produced by oxidation in the body from either retinal or retinol, but, once produced, cannot be reduced again.
Retinoic acid is responsible for all of the activity of vitamin A, save visual pigment effects, which require retinal (retinaldehyde), and for effects that require retinol in both the male and female reproductive tracts.
Vitamin A-deprived retinoic acid-supplemented male rats exhibit hypogonadism and infertility; similar treatment of female rats causes infertility due to fetal resorption.

Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular, pleomorphic bacillus and is the bacterium that causes Q fever.
Its only known targets are monocytes and macrophages.
C burnetii infection in humans is typically asymptomatic, but in acute disease can exhibit symptoms of a self-limited flu-like illness, pneumonia or hepatitis.
Symptoms of chronic C burnetii infection include primarily endocarditis, but also hepatitis and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Pregnant women infected with C burnetii may experience abortions, premature deliveries, and stillbirth.
Ticks are the reservoir and vector for C burnetii, and cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary sources of infection in humans.
C burnetii is transmitted in infected secretions, and people with predisposing factors such as underlying disease and compromised cell-mediated immunity are at a greater risk of symptomatic infection.
The shikimate dehydrogenase gene (aroE) is a housekeeping gene of C burnetti that is targeted in nucleic acid amplification assays to aid in the diagnose C burnetii infection.

One study reported a patient with atypical phenylketonuria caused by a 7, 8-dihydrobiopterin synthetase deficiency.
Glycine (Gly, G) is a nonpolar amino acid.
It is the simplest of the 20 standard (proteinogenic) amino acids: its side chain is a hydrogen atom.
Because there is a second hydrogen atom at the ÃÂ± carbon, glycine is not optically active.
Since glycine has such a small side chain, it can fit into many places where no other amino acid can.
For example, only glycine can be the internal amino acid of a collagen helix.
Glycine is very evolutionarily stable at certain positions of some proteins (for example, in cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin), because mutations that change it to an amino acid with a larger side chain could break the protein's structure.
Most proteins contain only small quantities of glycine.
A notable exception is collagen, which is about one-third glycine.
Methylparaben, also methyl paraben, one of the parabens, is a preservative with the chemical formula CH3(C6H4(OH)COO).
It is the methyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Chlorhexidine is a cationic chlorophenyl biguanido antiseptic and disinfectant and is commonly used as the diacetate or digluconate salt.
Its structure is symmetrical with two identical epitopes, which implies that chlorhexidine per se would be capable of cross linking IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells and basophiles thereby eliciting allergic reactions by histamine release in sensitized individuals.
This mechanism has been demonstrated with similar divalent drugs such as the muscle relaxant suxamethonium.
Exposure to the allergen often occurs as skin disinfection prior to surgery and blood tests or by urinary catheterization, disinfection of a drain insertion site, or placement of a central venous catheter.
Exposure also occurs upon use of gel in vaginal and rectal examinations and in connection with dental procedures.
Chlorhexidine exposure is also wide-spread in homes from use of numerous products such as cleaning fluids, toothpastes, mouth rinses etc.
Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) is a screening laboratory test for detecting the presence of lupus anticoagulants (LA), which are autoantibodies associated with excess clot formation, excess bleeding, and repeated miscarriages.
The coagulant in the venom directly activates factor X, which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of factor V and phospholipid.
If phospholipid antibodies are present, this reaction will be inhibited, which will prolong the screening dRVVT and suggests the presence of LA.
A confirmatory dRVVT test measures dRVVT in the presence of excess phospholipid, which saturates the antibody binding sites and thereby diminishes the inhibitory effect of the LA, resulting in a normalization of the dRVVT.
The dRVVT screen to confirm ratio is calculated as Screen dRVVT/Confirm dRVVT, and the dRVVT percent correction is calculated as x100.
Rheumatoid factor (RF or RhF) is a blood test performed in patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

One function is that Lp-PLA2 inactivates an important proinflammatory mediator known as platelet-activating factor (PAF).
The other function of Lp-PLA2 is that is oxidatively hydrolyzes modified polyunsaturated fatty acids resulting in the chemical compounds lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and oxidized nonesterified fatty acids (OxNEFA).
OxNEFA has powerful monocyte chemotactic activity.
LysoPC increase inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, adhesion molecules and the chemotactic mediator MCP-1.
LpPLA2 is positively associated with coronary disease but does not improve cardiovascular risk assessment over the traditional biomarkers.
LpPLA2 has been more useful for assessing patients with a borderline risk than traditional biomarkers.
LpPLA2 has been especially helpful when used to measure cardiac risk on patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes.
There is some speculation that LpPLA2 may eventually be used to monitor treatment efficacy.
Future risk assessments for coronary disease will likely include multiple combinations of cardiac risk markers.

Furoylglycine is an acyl glycine.
Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids.
However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:.
acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine.
Dietary studies show that 2-Furoylglycine precursors are of exogenous origin.
Most probably from furan derivatives found in food prepared by strong heating.
This may explain the absence of 2-furoylglycine in urine of breastfed children.

Porphyrins build up among patients with hereditary enzyme disorders known as porphyrias.
Porphyrias affect the heme biosynthetic pathway and cause increased urine excretion of porphyrinogens, by-products known as porphyrins and porphyrinogen precursors-including delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG).
Coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin excretion in urine is markedly increased during acute attacks of hereditary coproporphyria.
Increased uroporphyrinogen, uroporphyrin, and coproporphyrin excretion occurs in porphyria cutanea tarda.
Increased coproporphyrin excretion alone lacks specificity and sensitivity for lead testing and is likely to occur secondary to other diseases.

The Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) Receptor is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by IGF-1 and by the related growth factor IGF-2.
It belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors.
This receptor mediates the effects of IGF-1, which is a polypeptide protein hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin.
IGF-1 plays an important role in growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults - meaning that it can induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle and other target tissues.
Mice lacking the IGF-1 receptor die late in development, and show a dramatic reduction in body mass, testifying to the strong growth-promoting effect of this receptor.
Mice carrying only one functional copy of igf1r are normal, but exhibit a ~15% decrease in body mass.
The IGF-1R is implicated in several cancers, including both breast and prostate cancer.
In some instances its anti-apoptotic properties allow cancerous cells to resist the cytotoxic properties of chemotheraputic drugs or radiotherapy.
In breast cancer, where EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib are being used to inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway, IGF-1R confers resistance by forming one half of a heterodimer (see the description of EGFR signal transduction in the erlotinib page), allowing EGFR signaling to resume in the presence of a suitable inhibitor.
This process is referred to as crosstalk between EGFR and IGF-1R. It is further implicated in breast cancer by increasing the metastatic potential of the original tumour by inferring the ability to promote vascularisation.
Increased levels of the IGF-IR are expressed in the majority of primary and metastatic prostate cancer patient tumors.
Evidence suggests that IGF-IR signaling is required for survival and growth when prostate cancer cells progress to androgen independence.
In addition, when immortalized prostate cancer cells mimicking advanced disease are treated with the IGF-1R ligand, IGF-1, the cells become more motile.

Chromium is a mineral that humans require in trace amounts, although its mechanisms of action in the body and the amounts needed for optimal health are not well defined.
It is found primarily in two forms: 1) trivalent (chromium 3+), which is biologically active and found in food, and 2) hexavalent (chromium 6+), a toxic form that results from industrial pollution.
Our focus is exclusively on trivalent (3+) chromium.
Chromium is known to enhance the action of insulin.
Chromium also appears to be directly involved in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism, but more research is needed to determine the full range of its roles in the body.
Chromium is widely distributed in the food supply, but most foods provide only small amounts (less than 2 micrograms per serving).
Meat and whole-grain products, as well as some fruits, vegetables, and spices are relatively good sources.
In contrast, foods high in simple sugars (like sucrose and fructose) are low in chromium.

The M gene is the seventh segment and encodes the M1 (matrix protein) and M2 (membrane) proteins.
The M1 protein is located beneath the lipid membrane and functions to give support and strength to the viral envelope.
The M2 transmembrane protein is an ion channel that assists to uncover the virus once it is inside the host cell.
M1 and NP proteins together determine whether the influenza virus is type A, B, or C. M1 brings viral constituents together to the assembly location, playing important roles in the creation of viral particles and in the budding process.
Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2)-mediated drug metabolism is highly variable and often based on a patient's genotype.
Genetic testing is performed to identifying patients who are poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultrarapid metabolizers of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2.
The CYP1A2 c.3497G>A polymorphism is associated with decreased activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme.
The APOA1 gene is located on chromosome 11 at position q23.3.
This gene encodes apolipoprotein A-I, which is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma.
The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein, which promotes cholesterol efflux from tissues to the liver for excretion, and is a cofactor for lecithin cholesterolacyltransferase (LCAT), an enzyme responsible for the formation of most plasma cholesteryl esters.
This gene is closely linked with two other apolipoprotein genes on chromosome 11.
Defects in this gene are associated with HDL deficiencies, including Tangier disease, and with systemic non-neuropathic amyloidosis.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein.
Titanium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ti and atomic number 22.
It is a light, strong, lustrous, corrosion -resistant (including resistance to sea water and chlorine) transition metal with a white-silvery-metallic color.
Titanium is used in strong light-weight alloys (most notably with iron and aluminium), and in powdered form to other materials, such as graphite composites.
Its most common compound, titanium dioxide, is used in white pigments.
Examples in which white pigment, consisting of titanium oxide, is used, are correction fluid and commonly used white paint to repaint walls.
It is also used in toothpaste, white road marking paints and in white fireworks.
Substances containing titanium are called titaniferous.
The element occurs in numerous minerals with the main sources being rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed over the Earth.
Lutropin is a glycoprotein pituitary hormone, which is under complex regulation by hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and by gonadal sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone in females, and testosterone in males.
High concentrations of LH (during the follicular phase) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome interfere with conception, and may contribute to early pregnancy loss in these patients.
In males, LH has been called interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH) because of its effect on testosterone production by Leydig cells.
This is necessary for the normal maturation of spermatozoa.
LH measurement is used in evaluating the normalcy of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.
Measuring serum gonadotropin levels allows for distinguishing between primary gonadal failure and deficient gonadal stimulation.
LH measurement may be of clinical importance because growth hormone and LH are frequently the first hormones to be affected by pituitary disease.
Serum analysis of LH has also been found to be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility in women.
Secretion of LH and FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) is pulsatile in response to normal intermittent release of GnRH.
While both are pulsatile, LH exhibits circadian rhythm while FSH does not.
In females both LH and FSH vary over the course of the menstrual cycle, with peaks at ovulation.
Hev b 3 forms an integrated part of the "small rubber particles" It has a significant role in rubber synthesis because of its ability to synthesise long-chain polyisoprene.

a-lactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin are major allergens..
Small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) is a significant marker used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD).
sdLDL remains in the circulation longer than larger LDL particles, which increases its likelihood of modification including desialylation, glycation, and oxidation that enhance its atherogenicity.
The small size of sdLDL increases its ability to penetrate atrial walls, where its cholesterol is used in the development of atherosclerotic plaques.
In addition to sdLDL being associated with CVD, it has also been linked to dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease.
Though statins are used to lower sdLDL in many patients, no study has clearly shown them to be efficient at doing so.
This may in part be related to the many dissimilarities in sdLDL test methods.
The Interleukins belong to the family termed cytokines.
They are peptides used by immune and inflammatory cells to communicate and control cell operations.

The UGT1A1 gene (UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1) is located on chromosome 2q37.
This gene encodes a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme of the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic molecules, such as steroids, bilirubin, hormones, and drugs, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites.
This gene is part of a complex locus that encodes several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.
The locus includes thirteen unique alternate first exons followed by four common exons.
Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes.
Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini.
Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter.
The preferred substrate of this enzyme is bilirubin, although it also has moderate activity with simple phenols, flavones, and C18 steroids.
Mutations in this gene result in Crigler-Najjar syndromes types I and II and in Gilbert syndrome.

Desmosterol is an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol.
Desmosterolosis is a rare autosomal recessive inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis that is caused by defective activity of desmosterol reductase which results in an accumulation of demosterol (DHCR24,, combines a severe osteosclerotic skeletal dysplasia and includes 2-3 toe syndactyly with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS; the biochemical block in SLOS results in decreased cholesterol levels and increased 7-dehydrocholesterol levels).
Desmosterolosis is caused by mutation of the 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene (DHCR24).
Many of the malformations in SLOS and desmosterolosis are consistent with impaired hedgehog function.
The hedgehog proteins include Sonic hedgehog (SHH), which plays a major role in midline patterning and limb development.
Desmosterolosis, caused by defective activity of desmosterol reductase, combines a severe osteosclerotic skeletal dysplasia.
7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7, reduces the C7-C8 double bond in the sterol B ring to form cholesterol or desmosterol depending upon the precursor.
Desmosterol can be converted to cholesterol by DHCR24.
Therefore, SLOS and Desmosterolosis patients invariably have elevated levels of cholesterol precursor's 7-dehydrocholesterol (and its spontaneous isomer 8-dehydrocholesterol) and absent desmosterol., .

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or mucopolysaccharides are long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit.
This unit consists of an N-acetyl-hexosamine and a hexose or hexuronic acid, either or both of which may be sulfated.
Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid unit they contain (e.g. glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine).
They also vary in the geometry of the glycosidic linkage.
This family of carbohydrates is essential or important for the life of vertebrates and an assortment of lower animals.
GAGs form an important component of connective tissues.
GAG chains may be covalently linked to a protein to form proteoglycans.
An influenza virus that had never been identified as a cause of infections in people before the 2009 H1N1 (Swine flu) pandemic.
Genetic analyses of this virus showed that it originated from animal influenza viruses and was unrelated to the human seasonal H1N1 viruses that had been in general circulation among people since 1977.
Antibodies to the seasonal H1N1 virus did not protect against the pandemic H1N1 virus, however a significant percentage of people age 65 and older had some immunity against the pandemic virus.
After early outbreaks in North America in April 2009 the new influenza virus spread rapidly around the world.
Unlike typical seasonal flu patterns, the new virus caused high levels of summer infections in the northern hemisphere, and then even higher levels of activity during cooler months.
The virus also led to patterns of death and illness not normally seen in influenza infections.
Most of the deaths occurred among younger people, including those who were otherwise healthy.
Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol, which is formed by enzymatic conjugation of ethanol with glucuronic acid.
Alcohol in the urine is normally detected for only a few hours versus several days for EtG. EtG, therefore, can be used to monitor compliance programs for abstinence from alcohol.

CK8 is associated with multiple cancers, including cervical, breast, and thyroid .
Arsenic (As, CAS No. 7440-38-2) is a metalloid that exists in both inorganic and organic forms in the environment and is classified as a human carcinogen by the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and IARC (International Agency for Research in Cancer).
Arsenic levels are naturally higher in certain geographical areas, including regions of Asia, China, Chile, Mexico and United States.
Exposure to toxic levels of arsenic, mainly via ingestion of As contaminated water and food, occur in these areas as well as near hazardous waste sites or in the workplace.
Chronic exposure to low level of arsenic can cause skin lesions (e.g. melanosis, leucomelanosis, and keratosis), neurological effects, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers typically involving the skin, lung, and bladder.
High exposure levels to arsenic can cause death.
Veterinary Medicine: Arsenic is seldom reported since the concentrations normally found in animal feeds are significantly less than the toxic dietary concentration.
If arsenic poisoning occurs, signs of intoxication include reduce feed intake and depressed growth.
Some animal species can have convulsions and incoordination followed by posterior paresis and quadriplegia, blindness and decreased hemoglobin.
In pigs, cases of arsenic poisoning usually arise from the use of organic arsenical growth-promoting feed additives.

There are many strains of RHDV, and three major viral subtypes: RHDV ("classical RHDV"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and the recently emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb).
Classical RHDV and RHDVa comprise one serotype (RHDV1), while RHDV2 belongs to a different serotype.
Stigmasterol is a phytosterol, meaning it is steroid derived from plants.
As a food additive, phytosterols have cholesterol-lowering properties (reducing cholesterol absorption in intestines), and may act in cancer prevention.
Phytosterols naturally occur in small amount in vegetable oils, especially soybean oil.
One such phytosterol complex, isolated from vegetable oil, is cholestatin, composed of campesterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol, and is marketed as a dietary supplement.
Sterols can reduce cholesterol in human subjects by up to 15%.
The mechanism behind phytosterols and the lowering of cholesterol occurs as follows : the incorporation of cholesterol into micelles in the gastrointestinal tract is inhibited, decreasing the overall amount of cholesterol absorbed.
This may in turn help to control body total cholesterol levels, as well as modify HDL, LDL and TAG levels.
Many margarines, butters, breakfast cereals and spreads are now enriched with phytosterols and marketed towards people with high cholesterol and a wish to lower it.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), commonly called sleeping sickness or Triple E, is a zoonotic alphavirus and arbovirus present in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean.
EEEV was first recognised in Massachusetts, USA in 1831 when 75 horses died of encephalitic illness.
Epizootics in horses have continued to occur regularly in USA.
The causal agent, EEEV, was first isolated from infected horse brains in 1933.
In 1938, the first confirmed human cases were identified when thirty children died of encephalitis in northeastern USA.
These cases coincided with outbreaks in horses in the same regions.
The fatality rate in humans infected with EEEV is 35%.
EEEV is capable of infecting a wide range of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, but not all animals develop high enough levels of EEEV to be contagious to humans.
The virus is maintained in birds primarily through Culiseta melanura mosquitoes and transmission to other species occurs via mosquitoes.
CD27 is a lymphocyte cell surface marker.
B lymphocytes that do not express CD27 are typically classified as naive, while those that do are classified as memory cells.
Mature circulating B cells can be separated into three subpopulations based on cell surface CD27 and IgD expression: 1) naive B cells (CD27-IgD+); 2) memory B cells that have not undergone immunoglobulin class switching (CD27+IgD+); and 3) memory B cells that have class switched (CD27+IgD-).

A triglyceride (TG, triacylglycerol, TAG, or triacylglyceride) is an ester derived from glycerol and three fatty acids.
There are many triglycerides, depending on the oil source, some are highly unsaturated, some less so.
Triglycerides are the main constituents of vegetable oil (typically more unsaturated) and animal fats (typically more saturated).
In humans, triglycerides are a mechanism for storing unused calories, and their high concentrations in blood correlates with the consumption of starchy and fatty foods.
High levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream have been linked to atherosclerosis and, by extension, the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Diets high in carbohydrates, with carbohydrates accounting for more than 60% of the total energy intake, can increase triglyceride levels.

Ursodiol, also known as ursodeoxycholic acid and the abbreviation UDCA, is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria.
Primary bile acids are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder.
When secreted into the colon, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria.
Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats.
Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol.
Because of this property, ursodeoxycholic acid is used to treat (cholesterol) gallstones non-surgically.
While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (eg. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are chemopreventive, perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells.

Infrequently, there may be a third present below the terminal ones.
The spikelets closely overlap in two rows.
3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is a metabolite of isoleucine in man, animals and bacteria.
It is the alpha-keto acid analogue of isoleucine.
3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid is produced from isoleucine by cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase 1 (EC:2.6.1.42), whereupon it is further degraded by branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 to 2-Methyl-1-hydroxybutyl-ThPP.
It is used as a clinical marker for maple syrup urine disease (MSUD).

Posttransplantation complications can occur at any anastomosis site and can be life-threatening.
The CD79A and CD79B genes, located on chromosomes 19 and 17, respectively, encode the alpha and beta chains of the B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein.
When an antigen binds to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex, the B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in internalization of the BCR complex, transport to late endosomes, and antigen presentation.
The alpha chain also plays a role in cell surface expression of the BCR and differentiation of pro- and pre-B-cells.
Two different CD79A mutations that lead to a truncated alpha chain are associated with agammaglobulinemia 3, an autosomal recessive disease associated with low or absent serum antibodies and circulating B-cells that is characterized by severe infections early in childhood.

Bile acids are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile of mammals.
They are produced in the liver by the oxidation of cholesterol, and are stored in gallbladder and secreted into the intestine in the form of salts.
They act as surfactants, emulsifying lipids and assisting with their absorption and digestion.
Synthesis of bile acids is a major consumer of cholesterol.
The body synthesizes about 800 mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis.
In total about 20-30 grams of bile acids are secreted into the intestine daily; about 90% of excreted bile acids are reabsorbed (by active transport in the ileum) and recycled.
This is referred to as the enterohepatic circulation.
Since bile acids are made from endogenous cholesterol, the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids may be disrupted as a way to lower cholesterol.
This is the mechanism of action behind bile acid sequestrants.
IC-26 (methiodone) is a methadone analogue with IUPAC name 4-ethylsulfonyl-N,N-dimethyl-4,4- diphenylbutan-2-amine.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1 also known as UGT-1A is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the UGT1A1 gene.
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes are part of the glucuronidation pathway that transforms small lipophilic molecules, such as irinotecan, into water-soluble, excretable metabolites.
Reduced hepatic UGT1A1 activity to approximately 30% of normal is a hallmark of Gilbert syndrome, a benign condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Individuals with Gilbert syndrome may experience transient elevations in unconjugated plasma bilirubin in response to various triggers (e.g., fasting, infection, or medications).
Genotypes most commonly implicated in Gilbert syndrome are UGT1A1*28/*28 and UGT1A1*6/*6.
Genetic variations in UGT1A1 can also affect the response (i.e., efficacy or toxicity) to drugs metabolized by UGT1A1 (e.g., irintotecan) or that inhibit UGT1A1 function (e.g., atazanavir).
Selection of alternative dosing or agents may be necessary in individuals with certain UGT1A1 genetic variations.
Venous invasion (VI) is a well-established prognostic indicator in colorectal cancers and associated with an increase in risk of distant metastases.
VI can be classified as either intramural venous invasion (IMVI) or extramural venous invasion (EMVI).
IMVI is when a tumor cells are confined to veins within the bowel wall.
EMVI is when tumor cells are present in veins outside the bowel wall.
Either one or both may be present.
The presence of EMVI is a strong predictor of adverse outcome.

CCL18 is approximately 60% identical in amino acid sequence to CCL3.
It is expressed at high levels in lung and at lower levels in certain lymphoid tissues, such as the lymph nodes, and is chemotactic for activated T cells and nonactivated lymphocytes.
The gene for human CCL18 contains three exons and is located on chromosome 17.
Clusterin (apolipoprotein J) is a 75 - 80 kDa disulfide-linked heterodimeric protein associated with the clearance of cellular debris and apoptosis.
In humans, clusterin is encoded by the CLU gene.
This protein has several synonyms: dimeric acidic glycoprotein (DAG protein), testosterone repressed prostate message-2 (TRPM-2), sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) and complement lysis inhibitor (CLI).
Two studies found a statistical association between a SNP within the clusterin gene and the risk of having Alzheimer's disease.
Further studies have suggested that people who already have Alzheimer's disease have more clusterin in their blood, and that clusterin levels in blood correlate with faster cognitive decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, but have not found that clusterin levels predicted the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

2,8 dihydroxyadenine (DHA) is formed from adenine and elevated levels of DHA are associated with adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder.
Typically adenine is metabolized by ART, but when ART is deficient, adenine is converted to DHA by another enzyme, xanthine dehydrogenase.
DHA is cleared by the kidney and excreted in urine, but because it is insoluble in urine, it precipitates as crystals that can aggregate and form kidney stones.
DHA crystals can also precipitate within the renal tubules and interstitium and cause severe renal damage.

Sodium (Na) is a positively charged electrolyte and a mineral.
Eighty-five percent of Na is located in the blood and lymph fluid.
The hormone aldosterone that is secreted by the adrenal glands helps to regulate Na levels by signaling the kidneys to either retain or secrete it.
Damage or disease to the kidneys can lead to dangerous fluctuations of sodium.
Na plays a number of key roles in the homeostasis of the human body.
It helps to maintain blood volume by osmotically pulling water into the blood vessels.
Too much sodium in the blood may cause too much water to be brought into the blood vessels and lead to high blood pressure.
Muscles and nerves conduct electrical impulses that require charged particles including Na.
The electrical currents cause muscle cells to contract and nerve cells to relay electrical signals between them.
Too little sodium can lead to muscle spasms, cramps, headache, irritability, restlessness, nausea and fatigue.
Extreme hyponatremia can lead to confusion, hallucinations, decreased consciousness and coma.
Conversely, hypernatremia can cause lethargy or restlessness, deep tendon reflexes, muscle spasticity and seizures.

Electrooculography (EOG) is a technique for measuring the resting potential of the retina.
The EOG is used to assess the function of the pigment epithelium.
During dark adaptation, the resting potential decreases slightly and reaches a minimum ("dark trough" or "Dt") after several minutes.
When the light is switched on, a substantial increase of the resting potential occurs ("light peak" or "Lp"), which drops off after a few minutes when the retina adapts to the light.
The ratio of the voltages (i.e., light peak divided by dark trough) is known as the Arden ratio and is normally above 1.80.
The Arden ratio is often abnormal in retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, detached retina, Best disease and many other eye disorders.
Ki-67 nuclear antigen is a marker of cell proliferation.
In breast cancer specimens, the degree of Ki-67 staining, assessed using MIB-1, a monoclonal antibody, is associated with the degree of proliferation.
In general, tumors with higher degrees of proliferation are associated with worse prognosis.
While the baseline degree of Ki-67 staining may not be predictive, the change in the proportion of Ki-67 positive cells before and after therapy may be predictive of disease-free and overall survival.
JAK2 gene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase that adds a phosphate group to many cellular proteins responsible for signal transduction in a variety of cells.

The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection.
It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection.
However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host.
The infectious virion contains an inner "core particle" enclosing viral genome.
The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg.
During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease.
Therefore most hepatitis B diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc(both IgM and IgG).
CD28 is one of the molecules expressed on T cells that provide co-stimulatory signals, which are required for T cell activation.
CD28 is the receptor for B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86).
When activated by Toll-like receptor ligands, the B7.1 expression is upregulated in antigen presenting cells (APCs).
The B7.2 expression on antigen presenting cells is constitutive.
CD28 is the only B7 receptor constitutively expressed on naive T cells.
Stimulation through CD28 in addition to the TCR can provide a potent co-stimulatory signal to T cells for the production of various interleukins (IL-2 and IL-6 in particular).
Prolactin is an anterior pituitary hormone encoded by the PRL gene, synthesized and secreted by lactotrope cells in the adenohypophysis.
It is also produced in other tissues including the breast and the decidua.
Pituitary prolactin secretion is regulated by neuroendocrine neurons in the hypothalamus, most importantly by neurosecretory dopamine neurons of the arcuate nucleus, which inhibit prolactin secretion.
Prolactin levels may be checked as part of a sex hormone workup, as elevated prolactin secretion can suppress the secretion of FSH and GnRH, leading to hypogonadism, and sometimes causing erectile dysfunction in men.
Prolactin measurement may also be of use in distinguishing epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, as serum prolactin level usually rises following an epileptic seizure.

Beta aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) is a nonprotein amino acid that is an end product of pyrimidine metabolism.
The R and S enantiomers (previously named D-(minus)-BAIB and L-plus-BAIB) are produced from thymine and L-valine, respectively.
Under normal circumstances, urine contains predominantly R-BAIB (from thymine) because it is eliminated by filtration and tubular secretion, while plasma contains about 80% S-BAIB (from valine), which is reabsorbed in the kidneys.
In patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, thymine catabolism is decreased, which results in moderately decreased CSF concentration and markedly decreased plasma concentration of BAIB.
On the other hand, urine BAIB is elevated despite decreased breakdown of thymine, which indicates that there must be cross-over in the thymine and valine degradation pathways.
Deficiency of D-beta-aminoisobutyrate:pyruvate aminotransferase, an enzyme that is involved in the catabolism R-BAIB, also results in elevated urine BAIB and is associated with hyperuricemia.

Transcobalamins are carrier proteins which bind cobalamin (B12).
There are 2 types 1.
Transcobalamin I (TCN1), also known as haptocorrin, R-factor, and R-protein, is a glycoprotein produced by the salivary glands of the mouth.
It primarily serves to protect cobalamin (Vitamin B12) from acid degradation in the stomach by producing a Haptocorrin-Vitamin B12 complex.
Once the complex has traveled to the more neutral duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade haptocorrin, releasing free cobalamin, which now binds to intrinsic factor for absorption by ileal enterocytes.
2. Transcobalamin II (TCN2) binds cobalamin once it has been uptaken by enterocytes of the terminal ileum and the "Intrinsic Factor-Vitamin B12" complex has been degraded.
The TCII-Vit B12 complex then enters portal circulation and is processed in the liver.

Biotinidase is a human enzyme coded for by the BTD gene.
It facilitates the use and recycling of the B vitamin biotin, sometimes called vitamin H. It removes biotin from food because biotin is needed in its free form.
Biotinidase also recycles biotin from certain enzymes, known as carboxylases.
These enzymes are important in the processing of fats, carbohydrates and proteins.
Biotin is attached to the carboxylases through an amino acid called lysine, forming a complex called biocytin.
Biotinidase removes biotin from biocytin and makes it available to be reused by other enzymes.
Mutations in the BTD gene cause biotinidase deficiency.
Approximately 100 mutations in the BTD gene that lead to biotinidase deficiency have been discovered.
These mutations either prevent the enzyme from being made or cause the enzyme that is produced to be nonfunctional.

Porcine parvovirus (PPV) causes reproductive failure of swine characterized by embryonic and fetal infection and death, usually in the absence of outward maternal clinical signs.
The disease develops mainly when seronegative dams are exposed oronasally to the virus anytime during about the first half of gestation, and conceptuses are subsequently infected transplacentally before they become immunocompetent.
There is no definitive evidence that infection of swine other than during gestation is of any clinical or economic significance.
The virus is ubiquitous among swine throughout the world and is enzootic in most herds that have been tested.
Diagnostic surveys have indicated that PPV is the major infectious cause of embryonic and fetal death.
In addition to its direct causal role in reproductive failure, PPV can potentiate the effects of porcine circovirus type II (PCV2) infection in the clinical course of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)

Dehydroaripiprazole is the active metabolite of the parent drug aripiprazole which is used to treat acute schizophrenia and other psychoses.
Aripiprazole is metabolized to dehydroaripiprazole by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.
Dehydroaripiprazole binds with postsynaptic dopamine receptors and presynaptic autoreceptors, blocking dopamine from attaching to the receptors and preventing a postsynaptic response that is usually triggered by dopamine.
The blood levels of dehydroaripiprazole vary widely between patients who have taken the same dose of the drug.
Therapeutic monitoring is important to verify the patient's blood level is within the therapeutic range, to identify patients who are non-compliant in taking their medication, and to prevent drug toxicity.

Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, multilayered, icosahedral viruses composed of an outer layer, an inner layer, and a core.
After the immature, double-layered virus is assembled in the host cell cytoplasm, they bud across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acquire a temporary membrane that has on its surface the ER resident viral glycoproteins NSP4, VP4 and VP7.
The virus loses its temporary membrane and the NSP4 glycoprotein as it moves toward the center of the ER cisternae.
The VP4 and VP7 proteins are pushed to the outermost membrane layer and become the mature triple-layered rotavirus.
The outer capsid glycoprotein VP7 is believed to be important for the attachment to and entry in the host cell.
After it enters the host cell, the VP7 glycoprotein is lost.
When the host cell lyses, the mature virus are released.
There are eight groups of rotavirus, A through H. Groups A, B, C, and H are associated with an acute gastroenteritis and are found in humans and animals.
Groups D, E, F, and G are found only in animals.

Galectin-3 is approximately 30 kDa and, like all galectins, contains a carbohydrate-recognition-binding domain (CRD) of about 130 amino acids that enable the specific binding of Î²-galactosides.
Galectin-3 is encoded by a single gene, LGALS3, located on chromosome 14, locus q21-q22.
It is expressed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, cell surface, and extracellular space.
This protein has been shown to be involved in the following biological processes: cell adhesion, cell activation and chemoattraction, cell growth and differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.
Given galectin-3's broad biological functionality, it has been demonstrated to be involved in cancer, inflammation and fibrosis, heart disease, and stroke.
Studies have also shown that the expression of galectin-3 is implicated in a variety of processes associated with heart failure, including myofibroblast proliferation, fibrogenesis, tissue repair, inflammation, and Ventricular remodeling.
Elevated levels of galectin-3 have been found to be significantly associated with higher risk of death in both acute decompensated heart failure and chronic heart failure populations

Mutations in this gene cause glycogen storage disease type I (GSD1).
This disease, also known as von Gierke disease, is a metabolic disorder characterized by severe hypoglycemia associated with the accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys.
Types of tissue in teeth In Humans Enamel is a hard outer layer consisting primarily of calcium and phosphate.
Dentin is the inner layer, the bulk of the tooth.
Pulp is the core, containing nerves and blood vessels.
Cementum is the thin layer around the root; a bone -like material which connects the teeth to the jaw.
In Aardvarks Teeth lack enamel and have many pulp tubules, hence the name of the order Tubulidentata.
Teeth (singular, tooth) are structures found in the jaws of many vertebrates.
The primary function of teeth is to tear and chew food, and in some animals, particularly carnivores, for fighting and, or defense.
The roots of the teeth are covered by gums.
The protective enamel covers the teeth and helps prevent cavities.
Adult teeth naturally darken with age as the pulp within the tooth shrinks and dentin is deposited in its place.
Teeth are among the most distinctive features of mammal species and fossils as well.

Cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae, blue-green bacteria, and Cyanophyta) is a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis.
The name "cyanobacteria" comes from the color of the bacteria (Greek: ÎºÏÎ±Î½ÏÏ (kyanÃ³s) = blue).
Certain cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins including anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as, aplysiatoxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR, nodularin R (from Nodularia), or saxitoxin.
Sometimes a mass-reproduction of cyanobacteria results in algal blooms.
These toxins can be neurotoxins, hepatotoxins, cytotoxins, and endotoxins, and can be toxic and dangerous to humans and animals.
Several cases of human poisoning have been documented but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks.
Recent studies suggest that significant exposure to high levels of cyanobacteria causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
The Lake Mascoma ALS cluster and Gulf War veteran's cluster are two notable examples

Influenza virus from the family Orthomyxoviridae are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes containing seven to eight gene segments.
Of the five genera in the family, only influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B and C viruses are medically relevant to humans.
Influenza A and B viruses have a similar structure whereby these viruses each contain eight discrete single-stranded RNA gene segments, each encoding at least one protein.
Aquatic birds harboring avian IAV are the likely natural reservoir for all known IAV subtypes and are probably the original source of all human pandemic IAV strains.
IAV maintained in wild birds have been associated with stable host switch events to novel hosts including most often to domestic poultry but also to horses, swine, toothed whales and humans, among other species.
Although influenza virus B has been isolated from seals, type B is isolated almost always from humans.
Influenza C virus has been isolated from pigs and dogs.
While influenza B and C virus also cause illness in humans, host switch events and high mutation rates among IAV types causes respiratory infections in humans ranging from asymptomatic to fatal and are the cause of the influenza pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries.
Pandemics are attributed to "novel" viruses which possess a viral hemagglutinin (HA) to which humans do not have immunity.

The M. abscessus complex consists of three subspecies (M. abscessus subsp.
Abscessus, M. abscessus subsp.
Massiliense, M. abscessus subsp.
They are known to cause respiratory disease in cystic fibrosis and elderly patients as well as skin and soft tissue infections.
M. abscessus infections are often difficult to treat as many strains are resistant to most of the common antibiotics.
Their resistance to clarithromycin can be determined based on expression of the inducible ribomethylase gene, erm(41).
The presence of a full length functional erm(41)gene, which is specific for M. abscessus, confers inducible resistance to clarithromycin while the non-functional truncated erm(41) gene exhibits higher drug susceptibility.
Real-time PCR methods are performed to detect the presence of the full or truncated erm(41) gene and determine proper treatment for patients.

The DMPK gene (dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase) is located on chromosome 19q13.3.
The protein encoded by this gene is a serine-threonine kinase that is closely related to other kinases that interact with members of the Rho family of small GTPases.
Substrates for this enzyme include myogenin, the beta-subunit of the L-type calcium channels, and phospholemman.
The 3' untranslated region of this gene contains 5-37 copies of a CTG trinucleotide repeat.
Expansion of this unstable motif to 50-5,000 copies causes myotonic dystrophy type I, which increases in severity with increasing repeat element copy number.
Repeat expansion is associated with condensation of local chromatin structure that disrupts the expression of genes in this region.
Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been determined.

Tuna are several species of fish in the family Scombridae, mostly in the genus Thunnus.
Tuna are fast swimmers (they have been clocked at 77 kmh (48 mph)) and include several species that are warm-blooded.
Unlike most fish species, which have white flesh, the flesh of tuna is pink to dark red.
This is because tuna muscle tissue contains greater quantities of myoglobin, an oxygen-binding molecule, than the muscle tissue of most other fish species.
Some of the larger tuna species such as the bluefin tuna can raise their blood temperature above the water temperature with muscular activity.
This enables them to live in cooler waters.

HIV infection decreases the number of CD3+ CD4+ lymphocytes (also called CD4 T cells or T4 helper cells) while increasing (momentarily) the numbers of CD3+CD8+ lymphocytes (called CD8 T lymphocytes or cytotoxic T cells).
Thus the ratio of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes is decreased.
These counts are used for prognostic purposes and to guide in the retroviral therapy.
CDC has emphasized since 1997 that the number of CD3+ lymphocytes is necessary in addition to the number of CD4+ cells to reliably identify the T4 helper cells and the number of CD8+ cells.
Laboratory reports that include only CD4 or only CD8 in their nomenclature are most likely really measuring CD3+CD4+ cells and CD3+CD8+ cells, respectively.

Follow-up indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) testing is 88-96% specific for Babesia microti infection.
Symptoms of infection are noticeable 1-8 weeks after the tick bite.
Infection in 25% of adults and 50% of children by Babesiosis microti is asymptomatic.
The less severe symptoms of infection include hemolytic anemia, jaundice, shortness of breath, hemoglobinuria, which occur during parasitic multiplication.
Patients without spleens experience a much higher rate of RBC infection (85%) versus an RBC infection rate of 1-10% in patients with spleens.
Splenectomized patients are more likely to be symptomatic when infected with Babesia microti and often die within 5-8 days.
The vector of Babesia microti is the Ixodidae tick and the reservoirs are believed to be the white-footed mouse (Peromuscus Leucopus Rafinesque), the microtus vole (Microtus spp.) and the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).

Coumatetralyl is an anticoagulant of the 4-hydroxycoumarin vitamin K antagonist type.
Symptoms of overexposure relate to failure of the blood clotting mechanism and include bleeding gums and failure of blood clotting after skin wounds.
After one exposure the toxicity of coumatetralyl is relatively low, however if overexposure continues for several days the product becomes more toxic.
The product must therefore be constantly present in the bloodstream for more than 1 to 2 days in order to be highly toxic.
A single exposure, even though relatively large, may not produce toxic symptoms as the compound is quite rapidly metabolised.

Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial hormone that plays a role in sexual reproduction, particularly during labor to facilitate birth and after birth for maternal bonding and to stimulate breastfeeding.
Recent studies investigate oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including social recognition, pair bonding, anxiety, and maternal behaviors.
Testing for oxytocin levels is may be performed on serum, plasma, urine, and other biological fluid, including saliva.
Due to oxytocin's pulsatile release, it is difficult for plasma and urine sampling to capture rapidly changing patterns of oxytocin concentration.
Saliva testing in some cases provides a more reliable measurement, which allows for a better understanding of the factors regulating oxytocin release.
The CareConnections Functional Index (CCFI) is used in outpatient physical therapy clinics for patients with musculoskeletal or neuromuscular conditions to help measure patients' functional status and quantify the effectiveness of treatment.
Separate instruments are available for musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions.
The instruments include general questions related to functional status as well as specific questions related to either neuromuscular function or each affected musculoskeletal region, which can include one or more of the following: temporomandibular joint, cervical/thoracic, lumbar, upper extremity and lower extremity.
To calculate the CCFI, the patient's raw score is converted to a percentage by dividing the raw score by the maximum possible score based on the number of questions answered by the patient.
A higher score indicates a better functional status.
Patients can complete the instrument multiple times over the course of treatment and changes in their scores can be used to monitor therapy effectiveness.

Thiamin is one of the B vitamins.
The B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that are part of many of the chemical reactions in the body.
Thiamin (vitamin B1) helps the body's cells change carbohydrates into energy.
The main role of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the body, especially the brain and nervous system.
Thiamin also plays a role in muscle contraction and conduction of nerve signals.
Thiamin is essential for the metabolism of pyruvate.
Thiamin is found in: enriched, fortified, and whole grain products such as bread, cereals, rice, pasta, and flour, wheat germ, beef liver and pork, dried milk, egg, legumes and peas, nuts and seeds.
A lack of thiamin can cause weakness, fatigue, psychosis, and nerve damage.
Thiamin deficiency in the United States is most often seen in people who abuse alcohol (alcoholism).
A lot of alcohol makes it hard for the body to absorb thiamin from foods.
Unless those with alcoholism receive higher-than-normal amounts of thiamin to make up for the difference, the body will not get enough of the substance.
This can lead to a disease called beriberi.
In severe thiamin deficiency, brain damage can occur.
One type is called Korsakoff syndrome.
The other is Wernicke's disease.

It is a monoglycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylcholine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site.
Lysophosphatidylcholines can have different combinations of fatty acids of varying lengths and saturation attached at the C-1 (sn-1) position.
Fatty acids containing 16, 18 and 20 carbons are the most common. LysoPC(16:0), in particular, consists of one chain of palmitic acid at the C-1 position.
The palmitic acid moiety is derived from fish oils, milk fats, vegetable oils and animal fats.
Lysophosphatidylcholine is found in small amounts in most tissues.
It is formed by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2, as part of the de-acylation/re-acylation cycle that controls its overall molecular species composition.
It can also be formed inadvertently during extraction of lipids from tissues if the phospholipase is activated by careless handling.
In blood plasma significant amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine are formed by a specific enzyme system, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which is secreted from the liver.
The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acids of position sn-2 of phosphatidylcholine to the free cholesterol in plasma, with formation of cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine.
Lysophospholipids have a role in lipid signaling by acting on lysophospholipid receptors (LPL-R).

4-Hydroxyproline, or hydroxyproline (C 5 H 9 O 3 N), is an uncommon amino acid, abbreviated as HYP.
Hydroxyproline differs from proline by the presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the C (gamma) atom.
Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C).
The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy.
Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have also been demonstrated in Paget's disease.

Leukocytes or white blood cells (WBCs) are immune cells that fight infection, neoplasms and other inflammatory conditions, and mediate allergic responses.
There are five types of WBCs normally present in the circulation that are all derived from a similar stem cell in the bone marrow.
The five type of WBCs are divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of granules in the cytoplasm.
The granulocytes include the neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils.
The non-granulocytes include the lymphocytes and the monocytes.
The neutrophils fight infection by ingesting and digesting bacteria.
Eosinophils and basophils respond to allergic reactions and are capable of ingesting antigen-antibody complexes.
Monocytes phagocytose bacteria and release interferon to stimulate the immune system.
Lymphocytes are divided into T-cells and B-cells.
T-cell immunity is cellular and involves the activation of phagocytes and B-cell immunity uses antibodies to fight infection.
Both elevated and low leukocyte counts can be markers of infection and malignancy, and low leukocyte counts are associated with a variety of primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, depending on the WBC type(s) that are out of range.

Chloride is an essential mineral required by humans that is found mainly in body fluids.
It is an important, negatively charged ion in the blood, and a major electrolyte that helps to conduct electrical impulses.
Electrolytes including chloride are located in the blood, lymph, and intra- and extra-cellular fluid.
Chloride helps to regulate osmolarity by offsetting the positively charged sodium and potassium ions in the serum.
It combines with hydrogen to form hydrochloric acid in the digestive tract which breaks down proteins, absorbs metallic minerals, and activates intrinsic factor.
Chloride is absorbed both actively and passively in order to help maintain extracellular fluid volume.
There is a continuous exchange of chloride and bicarbonate that occurs between the red blood cells and the plasma that controls the pH and excretion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of respiration.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is an enzyme in the lyase family used in the metabolic pathway of gluconeogenesis.
It converts oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide.
It is found in two forms, cytosolic and mitochondrial.
This is a rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, the process by which cells synthesize glucose from metabolic precursors.
The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression.
To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in glucose homeostasis, over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far the most common form of diabetes in humans.
Due to the importance of blood glucose homeostasis, a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis.

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a coronavirus first identified as the cause of a respiratory illness outbreak in Wuhan, China.
Initially, the outbreak was linked to a large seafood and animal market and thought to only be spread by animal to person contact.
Within a short time, a growing number of patients who had not been exposed to animal markets were diagnosed with the infection, indicating person-to-person transmission.
As of January 2020, infections with 2019-nCoV had been reported internationally due to confirmed cases in travelers from Wuhan.
Overall, clinical symptoms appear milder than SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections as do the fatality rate and transmissibility.
Reported illnesses range from minor or no respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory illness and death.
The full genome of the 2019-nCoV was first posted by Chinese health authorities in GenBank, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAI) portal.
This facilitated detection of the virus globally with subsequent sequences being nearly identical, suggesting a single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.

Bone marrow or peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells are collected for patients scheduled to undergo stem cell (bone marrow) transplantation.
For autologous transplants, the patient donates his or her own cells.
For allogeneic transplants, a healthy donor provides cells for a patient.
Collected cells (harvested by aspiration from the marrow or by therapeutic apheresis from the blood after treatment of the donor with a stem cell mobilizing agent such filgrastim) are processed to concentrate the stem cells.
Stem cells may be further processed in a variety of ways, depending upon the source and volume of stem cells and the diagnosis of the recipient.
In selected cases, the concentrated stem cell preparation is processed to concentrate or eliminate cells found in the collection.
A special chemical mixture is added to protect cells during freezing, and they are frozen and stored at temperatures below 80 degrees Celsius until thawed for infusion into the patient.
Stem cell transplantation is used to replace diseased bone marrow, as in leukemia, or as an adjunctive measure for patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
For some diagnoses, stem cell transplantation procedures are experimental.
A megaloblast is an unusually large erythroblast that can be associated with pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency) and folic acid deficiency (collectively called megaloblastic anemia).
It is differentiated from a normoblast, which is a normally-sized erythroblast.
This kind of anemia leads to macrocytes (abnormally large red cells).
The cause of this cellular gigantism is an impairment in DNA synthesis which delays nuclear maturation and cell division.

In medicine, malignant is a clinical term that is used to describe a clinical course that progresses rapidly to death.
It is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behavior characterised by local invasion or distant metastasis.
The change of cells from benign to malignant behavior is called malignant transformation.
Usually this diagnosis is made by pathologic examination of tissues.
However, often the physician during the history and physical examination can find that there have been changes in size or patient sensation and upon direct examination that there has been a change in the lesion itself.
Malignant transformation is a synonym for progression to malignancy.
Transformation may take place as a primary or a secondary process.
Although malignant transformation may occur because of changes within the cell, it can be induced by inorganic toxic substances such as cadmium or arsenite and organics such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines.

Monomeric prolactin is the most common form of circulating prolactin.
Prolactin also has several isoforms, including the dimeric form ("big-prolactin") that has a molecular weight of ~50 kD and polymeric form ("big-big prolactin") that has a molecular weight of ~ 150 kD).
Big-big prolactin, known as macroprolactin, and big prolactin are formed in the circulation after secretion of prolactin from the pituitary.
They have a longer half-life than monomeric prolactin are not biologically active.
However, typical prolactin assays do not differentiate between the different forms of prolactin, and the presence of big and big-big prolactin can lead to a false diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia.
Methods such as PEG precipitation can separate macroprolactin and big prolactin from monomeric prolactin in order to obtain a more accurate measurement of biologically active prolactin, and chromatography can be used to further characterize the isoforms if necessary.

Red blood cells (RBCs) have surface antigens that play a role in determining compatibility for blood transfusions and organ transplants.
The common antigens on RBCs are from the ABO system and include A, B and H antigens.
The H antigen is a carbohydrate on the RBC surface which is the biosynthetic precursor required for the expression of the A and B antigens.
Cells that express H antigen and lack A and B antigens are, by default, in blood group O.
In rare cases, the H antigen is not expressed on the red cell membrane at all, which is described as having an O sub h or Bombay phenotype.
Individuals with the Bombay phenotype produce antibodies to the A, B and H antigens, which antibodies are capable of activating complement and causing hemolysis.
The only blood that a patient with Bombay phenotype may receive is that from another person who also expresses the Bombay phenotype.

It is a rate-limiting enzyme in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway.
Sialic acid modification of cell surface molecules is crucial for their function in many biologic processes, including cell adhesion and signal transduction.
Differential sialylation of cell surface molecules is also implicated in the tumorigenicity and metastatic behavior of malignant cells.
Mutations in this gene are associated with sialuria, autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy, and Nonaka myopathy.
Alternative splicing of this gene results in transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein produced by the parietal cells of the stomach.
It is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 later on in the small intestine.
Upon entry into the stomach, vitamin B12 becomes bound to one of two B12 binding proteins present in gastric juice.
In the less acidic environment of the small intestine, these proteins dissociate from the vitamin, enabling it to bind to intrinsic factor and enter the portal circulation through a receptor in the ileal mucosa specific for the B12 -intrinsic factor complex.
In pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease, autoantibodies directed against intrinsic factor or parietal cells themselves lead to an intrinsic factor deficiency, malabsorption of vitamin B12, and subsequent megaloblastic anemia.
Atrophic gastritis can also cause intrinsic factor deficiency and anemia through damage to the parietal cells of the stomach wall.

Left ventricular (LV) systolic dyssynchrony represents variability in the timing of contraction in different LV myocardial segments and is an indicator of LV systolic dysfunction.
LV dyssynchrony is evaluated using cardiac gated SPECT and is based on time to end-systole (TES) measurements for each of the 17 LV segments.
The TES measures the time from the end of diastole, which is the same for all segments, to the end of systole, which varies across segments depending on the degree of LV dysfunction.
The maximum difference in time to end-systole (MDTES), is the lag between the earliest and the latest end-systole among the 17 LV segments.
The standard deviation of time to end-systole (SDTES) is the standard deviation of TES among all of 17 LV segments.
Increasing MDTES and SDTES values, which represent increasing LV dyssynchrony, are associated with decreased LV ejection fraction and LV dysfunction.
The difference in time to end-systole between the lateral and septal segments (DTES-LS) is also derived from the TES.
MDTES, SDTES and DTES-LS are typically expressed as percentages.

Isovalerylglycine is an acyl glycine.
Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids.
However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine Isovalerylglycine is a byproduct of the catabolism of the aminoacid leucine.
Accumulation of isovalerylglycine occurs in Isovaleric Acidemia (IVA).
IVA (OMIM/ McKusick 243500) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene.
The deficiency of this enzyme in the metabolism of leucine leads to the accumulation of a series of isovaleryl-CoA metabolites, such as isovalerylglycine (IVG).
It is very important to caution for false positive results when screening for isovaleric acidemia by tandem mass spectrometry based on dried blood-spot levels of C5-acylcarnitines, including isovalerylcarnitine and its isomer, pivaloylcarnitine; pivaloylcarnitine is derived from pivalate-generating antibiotics, and has caused many false-positive results. .

Inversions in either intron 1 or intron 22 in the F8 gene together account for 45-50% of mutations associated with severe hemophilia A (HA) in males.
These inversions are typically not identified in patients with mild or moderate HA.
When an inversion mutation is identified in a family, males affected with severe hemophilia A in the same family may be tested for the mutation.
At-risk females also may be tested to determine their hemophilia A carrier status.
Aztreonam (AzactamÂ®) is a monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (a monobactam) originally isolated from Chromobacterium violaceum.
It is resistant to some beta-lactamases, but is inactivated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
Aztreonam is effective against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
It is not effective against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes.
Aztreonam has to be administered intravenously, as the compound is poorly absorbed when given orally.
Side-effects include reactions at the injection site, diarrhea and other gastro-intestinal symptoms.
There is limited cross-reactivity between aztreonam and other beta-lactam antibiotics, and it is generally considered safe to admininister aztreonam to patients allergic to penicillin.

It has sedative and anxiolytic actions like those of other benzodiazepines, and also has anti-parasitic effects against the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni.
The HR2 allele is a complex haplotype in exon 13 of the Factor V (F5) gene that consists of multiple polymorphisms throughout the gene, at least 4 of which result in amino acid changes.
The HR2 allele may result in lower FV levels, and patients who are compound heterozygous carriers of both HR2 and FV Leiden have increased resistance to activated protein C (APC) and a pro-thrombotic phenotype.
In fact, coinheritance of HR2 with the FV Leiden mutation is associated with a 3-4-fold increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to inheritance of FV Leiden alone.
The defining amino acid change of HR2 was originally thought to be His1299Arg, but after realizing that multiple missense variations are co-inherited with the His1299Arg change and by expressing each variant in isolation using recombinant DNA techniques, it was subsequently found that the Asp2194Gly change is the most important .
White ash is a tall, deciduous, long-lived tree, growing to a height of between 18 m and 40 m. Pollens from White ash can induce asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
Human adenovirus (HAdV) types 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, and 21 (all species B) and type 4 (species E) are most often associated with epidemic acute respiratory illness (ARI).
There are seven recognized HAdV species (A to G) with over 50 immunologically distinct types named across species.
HAdVs commonly infect children, causing diseases of the respiratory, ocular (conjunctivitis), and gastrointestinal tracts.
Most infections are mild and require only treatment of symptoms, but severe and occasionally fatal infections have been reported in various populations, such as infants and immunodeficient patients.
The HBA2 gene (hemoglobin, alpha 2) is located on chromosome 16p13.3.
The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome 16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5'- zeta - pseudozeta - mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'.
The alpha-2 (HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1) coding sequences are identical.
These genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated regions.
Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA, which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute HbA-2, which with HbF (fetal hemoglobin) makes up the remaining 3% of adult hemoglobin.
Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1; some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.
2-Hydroxybutyric acid (or alpha-hydroxybutyrate) is a hydroxybutyric acid with the hydroxyl group on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl.
It is a chiral compound having two enantiomers, D-2-hydroxybutyric acid and L-2-hydroxybutyric acid.
2-Hydroxybutyrate, the conjugate base of 2-hydroxybutyric acid, is produced in mammalian tissues (principally hepatic) that catabolize L-threonine or synthesize glutathione.
Oxidative stress or detoxification demands can dramatically increase the rate of hepatic glutathione synthesis.
Under such metabolic stress conditions, supplies of L-cysteine for glutathione synthesis become limiting, so homocysteine is diverted from the transmethylation pathway forming methionine into the transsulfuration pathway forming cystathionine.
2-Hydroxybutyrate is released as a byproduct when cystathionine is cleaved to cysteine that is incorporated into glutathione.
Chronic shifts in the rate of glutathione synthesis may be reflected by urinary excretion of 2-hydroxybutyrate.
The PLOD2 gene (procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2) is located on chromosome 3q24.
The protein encoded by this gene is a membrane-bound homodimeric enzyme that is localized to the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
The enzyme (cofactors iron and ascorbate) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagen-like peptides.
The resultant hydroxylysyl groups are attachment sites for carbohydrates in collagen and thus are critical for the stability of intermolecular crosslinks.
Some patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIB have deficiencies in lysyl hydroxylase activity.
Mutations in the coding region of this gene are associated with Bruck syndrome.

Zopiclone (brand names include Imovane, Zimovane, and many others) is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent used to treat insomnia.
Zopiclone is sedating and marketed as a sleeping pill.
Short term use is recommended as long term or daily use has been reported to cause dependence in some users.
Zopiclone has also been shown to have the potential for abuse and addition.
Zopiclone is not commercially available in the United States but in medical use in many countries.
The most frequently reported adverse effects are bitter or metallic taste, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness.
Zopiclone toxicology testing can be performed on body fluids, blood, urine and hair.
Zopiclone can be difficult to detect however, because it clears quickly from the body and may be in low dosages.
Hair testing may extend the window of detection and additionally may distinguish long term use from a single exposure.
A group of disorders which have in common elevations of tyrosine in the blood and urine secondary to an enzyme deficiency.
Type I tyrosinemia features episodic weakness, self-mutilation, hepatic necrosis, renal tubular injury, and seizures and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase.
Type II tyrosinemia features mental retardation, painful corneal ulcers, and keratoses of the palms and plantar surfaces and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme TYROSINE TRANSAMINASE.
Type III tyrosinemia features mental retardation and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme 4-HYDROXYPHENYLPYRUVATE DIOXYGENASE.

Malt is made most often from Barley, but sometimes from other grains such as Rye.
Malting is the controlled germination of cereals, followed by the termination of this process by the application of heat.
Further heat is then applied to "kiln" the grain and produce the required flavour and color.
Malt may uncommonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals, including Baker's asthma, urticaria, facial itching, Quincke edema, systemic symptoms and anaphylaxis.
Symptoms usually occurred after the consumption of Malt-containing chocolate drinks and Malt-containing snack products.
Aeromonas is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod that morphologically resembles members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
Fourteen species of Aeromonas have been described, most of which have been associated with human diseases.
The most important pathogens are A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria.
The organisms are ubiquitous in fresh and brackish water.
They group with the gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria.
Two major diseases associated with Aeromonas are gastroenteritis and wound infections, with or without bacteremia.
Gastroenteritis typically occurs after the ingestion of contaminated water or food, whereas wound infections result from exposure to contaminated water.
Although some potential virulence factors (e.g. endotoxins, hemolysins, enterotoxins, adherence factors) have been identified, their precise role is unknown.
Aeromonas species cause: 1.opportunistic systemic disease in immunocompromised patients 2.diarrheal disease in otherwise healthy individuals, and 3.wound infections
The CYP1A2 gene (cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 2) is located on chromosome 15q24.1.

NMP1 is translocated or mutated in various lymphomas and leukemias, forming fusion proteins (e.g. NPM-ALK, NPM-RARalpha, NPM-MLF1) or NPM mutant products.
NPM1 mutations (e.g. mutA, mutB, mutD) occur in about 30% of adult de novo AML and cause aberrant cytoplasmic expression of NPM.
Various molecular techniques are used for the detection of NPM1 gene alterations.
Findings contribute to diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of minimal residual disease of various lymphomas and leukemias.
Chromosomal translocation t(1;19)(q23.3;p13.3) PBX1/TCF3 is caused by a breakpoint in 19p13.3 and occurs in two different forms: 1) a balanced form found in one fourth of cases with a der(1) and a der(19) and 2) an unbalanced form found in 3/4 cases with 2 normal chromosomes 1, a der(19), and 1 normal chromosome 19.
This translocation is mostly found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), L1/L2 type, as well as L3-like ALL, T-lineage ALL (T-ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and acute myeloid leukemias (AML).
Naltrexol has two forms: 6-beta naltrexol and 6-alpha naltrexol.
6-Beta naltrexol (6Î²-Naltrexol) is the major urinary metabolite of Naltrexone in man and has a significant pharmacological activity and a longer elimination half-life than the parent drug.
Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.
Relative to naltrexone, 6Î²-naltrexol has about half the affinity for the Î¼-opioid receptor, but is present at approximately 10-30-fold higher concentrations at steady state due to extensive first-pass metabolism of the parent drug.
Cache Valley virus (CVV) was isolated in Cache Valley, Utah, in 1956.
CVV is a mosquito borne member of the Bunyamwera serogroup belonging to the family Peribunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus.
The primary vectors are unknown; however CVV has been isolated in multiple mosquito species including Anopheles, Culiseta, Coquillettidia, Aedes, and most commonly Anopheles quadrimaculatus.

Clostridium difficile toxin B is a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium difficile.
C. difficile produces two major kinds of toxins that are very potent and lethal; an enterotoxin (Toxin A) and a cytotoxin (Toxin B, this protein).
Early studies suggested that toxin A (also known as TcdA) is the major toxin protein causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD); however, within the last decade it has been shown that Toxin B (or TcdB) plays a more important role in disease than anyone had forecasted.
Toxin B has been identified as the major virulence factor that causes the opening of tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells, which enables toxin to increase vascular permeability and induce hemorrhaging.
Lithium, symbol Li and atomic number 3, is one of only four elements thought to have been created in the first few seconds following the "Big Bang" nucleosynthesis.
It is in group 1 of the periodic table, among the alkali metals and is the lightest solid element.
Lithium is a soft, silver white metal that does not exist on earth in its pure form.
Lithium reacts with oxygen to form black lithium oxide (Li2 O).
It therefore has to be stored under the cover of oil to stop its oxidation.
Lithium metal is used primarily in heat-transfer applicationns such as batteries (mainly cell phone and camera batteries), household appliances (toasters and microwaves) and in high performance alloys (aircraft construction).
The NPHP1 gene (nephronophthisis 1 (juvenile)) is located on chromosome 2q13.
This gene encodes a protein with src homology domain 3 (SH3) patterns.
This protein interacts with Crk-associated substrate, and it appears to function in the control of cell division, as well as in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion signaling, likely as part of a multifunctional complex localized in actin- and microtubule-based structures.
Mutations in this gene cause familial juvenile nephronophthisis type 1, a kidney disorder involving both tubules and glomeruli.
Defects in this gene are also associated with Senior-Loken syndrome type 1, also referred to as juvenile nephronophthisis with Leber amaurosis, which is characterized by kidney and eye disease, and with Joubert syndrome type 4, which is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, psychomotor delay and neonatal breathing abnormalities, sometimes including retinal dystrophy and renal disease.

Chloride is found in many chemicals and other substances in the body.
It is one of the components of salt used in cooking and in some foods.
Chloride is needed to keep the proper balance of body fluids and an essential part of digestive (stomach) juices.
Chloride is found in table salt or sea salt as sodium chloride, and also found in many vegetables.
Foods with higher amounts of chloride include seaweed, rye, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, and olives.
Too little chloride can occur when the body loses a lot of fluids, and may be due to heavy sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Medicines such as diuretics can also cause low chloride levels.
Too much chloride from salted foods can; increase blood pressure, or cause a buildup of fluid in people with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney disease.
Zalcitabine, also called dideoxycytidine, is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NARTI) sold under the trade name Hivid.

Substances which lower blood glucose levels.
Arachidonate (AA) is an essential polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that is produced from dietary linoleic acid.
AA is located in human fat, liver, brain, and glandular organs and is a mediator of inflammation.
The AA within the phospholipids of cell membranes is the surface where the production of a number of biologically active compounds occurs.
A few of the compounds produced includes prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes which regulate processes including platelet aggregation, blood clotting, smooth muscle contraction, leukocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory cytokine production, and immune function.
AA is released from the cell membrane when acted upon by phospholipases and then metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) producing the prostanoids prostaglandin and thromboxane A2, which can stimulate or mitigate inflammation.
One of the benefits of the Omega-3 fatty acids for patients with inflammatory disease is believed to be their selective modification of the metabolism of AA by the omega-3 fatty acids that results in a reduced amount of inflammation.
Alloisoleucine+Isoleucine+Leucine+Hydroxyproline is a primary marker for Maple syrup urine disease and Hydroxyprolinemia
The ACSL4 gene (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4) is located on chromosome Xq22.3-q23.
The protein encoded by this gene is an isozyme of the long-chain fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase family.
Although differing in substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution, all isozymes of this family convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation.
This isozyme preferentially utilizes arachidonate as substrate.
The absence of this enzyme may contribute to the mental retardation or Alport syndrome.
Alternative splicing of this gene generates 2 transcript variants.
An immunoblastic lymphocyte is a lymphocyte that has been activated by an antigen, which will further undergo clonal expansion to increase the number of lymphocytes capable of binding to that antigen.
Immunoblasts are the most immature members of the protective cells involved in an immune response.
The majority of lymphocytes are small and have a thin rim of cytoplasm, 6-9 Âµm in diameter, about the same size as erythrocytes (diameter 7.5 Âµm).
Large lymphocytes (12-18 Âµm in diameter) are probably activated, i.e. immunoblasts, with a paler and wider rim of cytoplasm and are often mistaken for monocytes.
Direct or indirect contact with bird allergens may cause sensitisation.
Bird allergens may be major components of house dust.
Budgerigar and Parakeet are the common names for a widespread group of small Parrots, native to the Indo-Malayan-Australian region and now the most popular cage birds in the world.
Parakeets have long, pointed tails, unlike the chunky Lovebirds with which they are sometimes confused.
The wild Budgerigar of Australia is usually green or blue with black and yellow markings; as a cage bird, however, it has been bred in many color varieties.
D antigen is part of the Rh blood group system.
Most people have red blood cells that either express the D antigen (D+) or don't (D-), but there are some people that have a phenotype that does not strictly fall into either the D+ or D- category.
There are many types of D variants.
"Weak D" is a D variant in which all epitopes of the D antigen are expressed, but in smaller quantity than usual.
Patients with the weak D variant do not typically have anti-D antibodies.
"DEL" is a variant in which D expression is low enough that it cannot be identified using typical serology.
"Partial D" is a variant in which only some epitopes of the D antigen are expressed.
Patients with the partial D variant may have anti-D antibodies, specifically to those epitopes that are not expressed.
Testing for D variants is especially important in patients who need chronic transfusions and pregnant women.

Stercobilin is a tetrapyrrolic bile pigment and is one end product of heme catabolism.
It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human fecal materia.
Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers.
In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen.
As a result, no stercobilin is formed.
This lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored.
Product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene.
It is a nuclear phosphoprotein hypothesized to normally act as an inhibitor of cell proliferation.

Found in body fluids of children with severe psychomotor delay and autism.
25-Hydroxyvitamin D is routinely measured by LC-MS/MS; a technology that fractionates 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
Each of these matabolites can be further fractionated into their 3"-epimers.
It was reported in 2006 that 3-epi-25-Hydroxyvitamin D can be present in clinically significant amounts in very young children.
It was further reported in 2012 that adults also can have significant 3-epi-25-OH Vitamin D in their serum.
Because the physiological activity of the 3' epimer is likely less than that of 25-hydroxyvitaminD3, it some believe it is important to measure it.
Enhanced HPLC-MS/MS separation can be used to fractionate all four 25-hydroxyvitamin D metaboliltes: 25-OH-D2, 25-OH-D3, 3-epi-OH-D2 and 3-epi-OH-D3.

Escherichia coli (EC) is a gram-negative, flagellated, rod-shaped bacterium.
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is colonized by EC within hours of birth.
The natural barriers of the GI tract prevent infection by symbiotic EC except when they break down such as in peritonitis.
EC occupy the mucous layer of the mammalian colon and is the most numerous anaerobe of the intestinal microflora.
Some strains of EC have evolved virulence factors that precipitate serious disease including enteric diarrhea, urinary tract infections, sepsis and meningitis.
The intestinal pathogens of EC include six pathotypes defined by the virulence factors they express.
These include: enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli(EHEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC).
Uropathogenic EC (UPEC) is the most common EC infection that occurs outside the GI tract.
The EC pathotypes that infects extraintestinal locations have been designated ExPEC.
The EC pathotypes that infect animals and cause disease include EPEC, EHEC and ETEC.
1,4-Benzoquinone, commonly known as para-quinone, is a chemical compound with the formula C6H4O2.
In pure state, it forms bright yellow crystals with characteristic irritating odor, resembling that of chlorine; impure samples are often dark colored due to the presence of quinhydrone (1:1 complex of quinone with hydroquinone).
This six-membered ring compound is the oxidized derivative of 1,4-hydroquinone.
The molecule is multifunctional: it exhibits properties of a ketone, forming an oxime; an oxidant, forming the dihydroxy derivative; and an alkene, undergoing addition reactions, especially those typical for Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketones.
1,4-Benzoquinone is sensitive towards both strong mineral acids and alkali, which cause condensation and decomposition of the compound.
1,4-Benzoquinone is a toxic metabolite found in human blood and can be used to track exposure to benzene or mixtures containing benzene and benzene compounds, such as petrol.
The compound can interfere with cellular respiration, and kidney damage has been found in animals receiving severe exposure.
It is excreted in its original form and also as variations of its own metabolite, hydroquinone.
Benzoquinone compounds are a metabolite of paracetamol.
Morphine is an extremely powerful opiate analgesic drug and is the principal active agent in opium.
Like other opioids such as heroin, morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain, in particular by targeting the synapses of the arcuate nucleus.

Lactose is a disaccharide that consists of -D-galactose and -D-glucose molecules bonded through a 1-4 glycosidic linkage.
Lactose makes up around 2-8% of the solids in milk.
The name comes from the Latin word for milk, plus the -ose ending used to name sugars.
Its empirical formula is C12 H22 O11 and its molecular weight is 342.3 gmol.
Digestion of lactose:Infant mammals are fed on milk by their mothers.
To digest it an enzyme called lactase (1-4 disaccharidase) is secreted by the intestinal villi, and this enzyme cleaves the molecule into its two subunits for absorption.
Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most species the production of lactase gradually ceases with maturity, and they are then unable to metabolise lactose.
This loss of lactase on maturation is also the default pattern in most adult humans.
Free Trichloroethanol is a major metabolite of chloral hydrate that is used to determine occupational exposure.
Cladosporium is one of the most common colonizers of dying and dead plants and also occurs in various soil types, and on food.
This mold is frequently found in uncleaned refrigerators, foodstuffs, on moist window frames, in houses with poor ventilation, with straw roofs, and situated in low, damp areas.
It has been isolated from fuel tanks, face creams, paints and textiles.
In the allergic population, sensitisation to moulds may vary from 5 to 30%.
The wide range of allergenic proteins in C. herbarum may result in sensitisation and subsequent expression of a range of immune-related diseases.
Cladosporium sensitisation is particularly associated with severe or life-threatening asthma.
Upper respiratory symptoms occur with exposure to Cladosporium, but asthma symptoms are more prevalent.
Cladosporium may also result in allergic bronchopulmonary cladosporiosis.
Arachidic acid, also called eicosanoic acid, is a saturated fatty acid found as a minor constituent of peanut oil and corn oil.
Its name derives from the Latin arachis - peanut.
It can be formed by the hydrogenation of arachidonic acid.
Reduction of arachidic acid yields arachidyl alcohol.
Aldolase glycolytic enzyme that splits fructose 1,6-diphosphate.
It is present most significantly in skeletal and heart muscle, although all cells contains samll amount, and the liver has a moderate concentration.
Damage to skeletal muscle produces high levels of aldolase; this is particularly so in the case of progressive muscular dystrophy in which levels may be 10-15 times normal.
There is no aldolase elevation in muscle diseases of neural origin such as neurogenic muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, myasthenia gravis and multiple sclerosis, but any of the inflammatory conditions involving muscle may cause moderately elevated values.
Used for the differential diagnosis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and in carriers lesser degrees of elevation in dermatomyositis, polynyositis, and limb-girdle dystrophy.
In recent years, CK is used more often for diagnosis of muscular dystrophy.
Phencyclidine (PCP) is a widely used hallucinogen that exhibits stimulating, depressing, and analgesic properties.
PCP, also known as "angel dust", causes psychosis and may result in violent behavior.
PCP may be a powder, tablet, liquid, spray or capsule, and it may be swallowed, smoked, sniffed, or injected.
Effects include increased heart rate and blood pressure, flushing, sweating, dizziness, numbness, drowsiness, convulsions, and coma.
PCP can be found 7 days following use and up to 2-4 weeks later in chronic users.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with the fusion of the breakpoint cluster gene (BCR) at chromosome 22q11 to the Abelson gene (ABL1) at chromosome 9q23.
The t(9;22)(BCR-ABL1) gene translocation leads to the cytogenetic finding known as the Philadelphia chromsome (Ph').
Various breakpoints within the BCR and ABL1 genes have been described.
Most cases of CML are due to a fusion of BCR exon 13 (e13 or b2) or BCR exon 14 (e14 or b3) to the ABL exon 2 (a2).
The b2a2 (e13a2) and b3a2 (e14a2) fused transcripts, also known as major break points, produce a 210-kDa protein (p210).
The fused transcript resulting in a 190-kDa protein (e1a2 or less common e1a3), also known as minor break points, is found in approximately 75% of childhood ALL patients and 50% of adult ALL patients.
Other rarely reported fused transcripts include e6a2, e19a2 (p230), e13a3, and e14a3.
Coagulation factor XIII strongly affects fibrin clot structure and function.
FXIII is converted by thrombin into activated FXIII (FXIIIa).
Factor XIIIa inhibits fibrinolysis by forming fibrin-fibrin and fibrin-inhibitor cross-links Studies have reported various magnitude and mechanisms of inhibition.
However, Factor XIIIa most strongly inhibits lysis of mechanically compacted or retracted plasma clots .
During myocardial contraction, as the wall shortens, it also thickens and warrants assessment of all parameters as useful for evaluation of contractile function: positive strain (radial thickening), negative strain (circumferential shortening and longitudinal shortening).
Radial mechanics of the heart are reflected by the myocardial shortening and thickening.
Parasternal short-axis and apical views from Doppler-determined strain measurements are used for recording radial strains.
Radial strain has been found to be altered after longitudinal and circumferential mechanics during the ischemic cascade, occurring only in the presence of flow-limiting stenosis during dobutamine.
Radial strains may be significantly decreased after infarction and lowest in the infarcted segments.
Radial strains, alone, are not strong predictors of infarct size.
Values for radial strain are positive.

In 1973 a new antigen was reported that occurred in 5% of Indians from Bombay.
Two years later, Dr. Giles reported the Salis serum which contained an antibody to a high frequency antigen that was antithetical to Ina, thus, it was named Inb.
A higher frequency of Ina has been found in some Arabs (10-12%).
Both of the Indian antigens can be suppressed by the In(Lu) gene (LU).
In addition, the null phenotype, ie. "In(a-b-)", has been reported in a patient diagnosed with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.
In this case there appears to be a silent allele present (no protein is produced) but the exact molecular basis for this is unknown at this time.
A metallic element that has the atomic symbol Bi, atomic number 83 and atomic weight 208.98.
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that assists in regulating blood pressure.
ACE helps convert angiotensin I (inactive) to angiotensin II (active).
Angiotensin II acts as a vasopressor and causes arteries to contract, increasing blood pressure.
Medications called ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in order to decrease blood pressure.
The levels of ACE in the blood are also used in order to diagnose sarcoidosis.
High levels of ACE in the blood could indicate early sarcoidosis and low levels of ACE in the blood could indicate chronic obstructive pulminary disease (COPD) or hypothyroidism.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes an infectious disease of the central nervous system.
TBEV has 3 subtypes: European (milder disease), Siberian (more severe), and Far Eastern (more chronic).
The disease most often manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis.
Although TBE is most commonly recognized as a neurological disorder, mild fever can also occur.
Long-lasting or permanent neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in 10-20% of infected patients.
Diagnosis of TBE is usually determined by the presence of TBEV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum or cerebral spinal fluid by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA).
Hydrogen breath test using glucose or lactulose is performed to diagnose Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome (SBBOS) or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).
The patient is either given a challenge dose of glucose, also known as dextrose (75-100 grams), or lactulose (10 grams).
A baseline breath sample is collected, and then additional samples are collected at 15 minute or 20 minute intervals for 3-5 hours.
A lactulose breath test is typically positive if the patient produces approximately 20 ppm of hydrogen and/or methane within the first two hours (indicates bacteria in the small intestine), followed by a much larger peak (colonic response).
This is also known as a biphasic pattern.
Lactulose is not absorbed by the digestive system and can help determine distal end bacterial overgrowth, which means the bacteria are lower in the small intestine.
Glucose is absorbed by the digestive system so studies have shown it to be harder to diagnose distal end bacterial overgrowth since the glucose typically doesn't reach the colon before being absorbed.
An increase of approximately 12 ppm or more in hydrogen and/or methane during the breath test could conclude bacterial overgrowth.
Multivitamin and minerals (MVMs) are popular dietary supplements and, according to estimates, more than one-third of all Americans take these supplements.
MVMs account for almost one-sixth of all purchases of dietary supplements and 40% of all sales of vitamin and mineral supplements.
No standard or regulatory definition is available for an MVM supplement-such as what nutrients it must contain and at what levels.
Therefore, the term can refer to products of widely varied compositions and characteristics.
Bretylium (also bretylium tosylate) is an antiarrhythmic agent.
It blocks the release of noradrenaline from nerve terminals.
In effect, it decreases output from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.

N-acetyl-lysine is an acetylated amino acid.
Post-translational lysine-acetylation is one of two major modifications of lysine residues in various proteins.
Acetylation of specific lysine residues in the N-terminal domains of core histones is a biochemical marker of active genes.
Acetylation is now known to play a major role in eukaryotic transcription.
Specifically, acetyltransferase enzymes that act on particular lysine side chains of histones and other proteins are intimately involved in transcriptional activation.
By modifying chromatin proteins and transcription-related factors, these acetylases are believed to regulate the transcription of many genes.
The best-characterized mechanism is acetylation, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes.
HATs function enzymatically by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to the -amino group of certain lysine side chains within a histone's basic N-terminal tail region.
Within a histone octamer, these regions extend out from the associated globular domains, and in the context of a nucleosome, they are believed to bind the DNA through charge interactions (positively charged histone tails associated with negatively charged DNA) or mediate interactions between nucleosomes.
Lysine acetylation, which neutralizes part of a tail region's positive charge, is postulated to weaken histone-DNA or nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and/or signal a conformational change, thereby destabilizing nucleosome structure or arrangement and giving other nuclear factors, such as the transcription complex, more access to a genetic locus.
In agreement with this is the fact that acetylated chromatin has long been associated with states of transcriptional activation.
Specific recognition of N-acetyl-lysine is a conserved function of all bromodomains found in different proteins, recognized as an emerging intracellular signaling mechanism that plays critical roles in regulating gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal organization.
The teratozoospermia index (TZI) is a measure in the number of abnormalities per ABNORMAL spermatozoon.

Clara cell protein 16 (CC16, sometimes referred to as CC10, clara cell secretory protein or uteroglobin) is an anti-inflammatory protein belonging to the secretoglobin family.
It is secreted from clara cells, non-ciliated cells found in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lungs.
CC16 is a biomarker for several conditions, including asthma, lung injuries, exposure to asbestos, fetal pulmonary hypoplasia, and cardiac pleural congestion.
In serum, an increase is associated with sarcoidosis and exposure to asbestos, for example.
Decreased levels are associated with asthma, pulmonary edema and acute lung injuries.
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) represent 5% of all salivary gland tumors and 20% of salivary malignancies.
A portion of these carcinomas are associated with gene rearrangements involving the the C-terminal of mastermind-like gene 2 (MAML2) and either cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) or 3 (CRTC3).
CTCR1-MAML2 fusion has been detected in 40-80% of primary salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinomas.
MECs positive for MAML2 fusions (CRTC1-MAML2 or CRTC3-MAML2) are associated with favorable clinicopathological tumor features, including lower patient age, a mild female predilection, a smaller tumor size, less frequent nodal metastasis, a lower clinical stage, a lower histological grade, and longer overall and disease-free survival.
Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription, subunit 12 homolog (S. cerevisiae), also known as MED12, is a human gene found on the X chromosome.

The juvenile and adult forms of MLD typically have a more variable and less severe course.
During inspiration and expiration, airway pressure changes, falling during inspiration and rising during expiration.
When a patient has a tracheal tube, these pressure changes can be measured.
Causes of high airway pressure include asynchronous breathing, pneumothorax, bronchial obstruction or hyperinflation and bronchospasm.
Onion in the general sense can be used for any plant in the genus Allium but used without qualifiers usually means Allium cepa, also called the garden onion.
Onions (usually but not exclusively the bulbs) are edible with a distinctive strong flavour and pungent odour which is mellowed and sweetened by cooking.
They generally have a papery outer skin over a fleshy, layered inner core.
Used worldwide for culinary purposes, they come in a wide variety of forms and colors.
Onions may be grown from seed or very commonly from sets.
Onion sets are produced by sowing seed very thickly one year, resulting in stunted plants which produce very small bulbs.
These bulbs are very easy to set out and grow into mature bulbs the following year, but they have the reputation of producing a less durable bulb than onions grown directly from seed and thinned.
The organ or other body structure invaded by a tumor.
For example, breast tumors can invade the chest wall, skeletal muscle and skin, and colon cancer can invade many organs or structures, including the pancreas, urinary bladder, ovary, uterus, and coccyx.

Gliadins are naturally occurring water and salt insoluble proteins of wheat.
They are made up of several components, including alpha/beta (nTri a 21), gamma (nTri a 20), and omega (nTri a 19) based on their electrophoretic mobility at a low pH.
The omega gliadin is further subdivided into two groups known as fast and slow omega gliadins.
The water and salt insoluble gliadin proteins are associated with wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA).
WDEIA is a severe allergic reaction that is characterized by symptoms that range from urticaria to respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular distress that is brought on by exercise 1 to 4 hours after the ingestion of wheat.
Factors other than exercise that can induce the severe reaction to wheat ingestion include: ingesting aspirin or alcohol, infections, stress, female sex hormones or menstruation.
The presence of gliadin IgE antibodies in patient serum is useful in diagnosing WDEIA.
The gamma and omega gliadin allergens may also be important to identifying severe allergy to ingested wheat.
Streptomycin is an antibiotic drug, the first of a class of drugs called aminoglycosides to be discovered, and was the first antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis.
It is derived from the actinobacterium Streptomyces griseus.
Streptomycin stops bacterial growth by damaging cell membranes and inhibiting protein synthesis.
Specifically, it binds to the 23S rRNA molecule of the bacterial ribosome, which prevents the release of the growing protein (polypeptide chain).
Humans have structurally different ribosomes than bacteria, thereby allowing the selectivity of this antibiotic for bacteria.
Streptomycin cannot be given orally, but must be administered by regular intramuscular injection.
An adverse effect of this medicine is ototoxicity.
It can result in permanent hearing loss.
History:It was first isolated on October 19, 1943 in the laboratory of Selman Abraham Waksman at Rutgers University by Albert Schatz, a graduate student in his laboratory.

It is either an off-white or yellow solid, depending on its purity, with a musty odor.
The AGA gene (aspartylglucosaminidase) is located on chromosome 4q34.3.
Aspartylglucosaminidase is involved in the catabolism of N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins.
It cleaves asparagine from N-acetylglucosamines as one of the final steps in the lysosomal breakdown of glycoproteins.
The lysosomal storage disease aspartylglycosaminuria is caused by a deficiency in the AGA enzyme.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been identified.
Estriol (also oestriol) is one of the three main estrogens produced in humans.
It is only produced in large amounts during pregnancy as it is made by the placenta.
Levels of estriol in non-pregnant women do not change much after menopause, and levels are not significantly different from those in men.
Estriol levels can be a good indicator of the health of the fetus.
DHEA is produced by the adrenal cortex of the fetus, this is converted to estriol by the placenta.
Low levels during pregnancy may indicate a problem with the development in the child.
As a first step of the patient nutrition care process, five categories are evaluated: 1) food and nutrition related history, 2) anthropometric measures, 3) biochemical data, 4) medical tests and procedures, and 5) client history.
This information is compared to criteria, relevant norms and standards for interpretation and decision making.
This then is the base for the nutrition diagnosis statements.

House Rats comprise two species, Rattus norvegicus, the Brown or Norway Rat, and Rattus Rattus, the Black or Alexandrine Rat.
Direct or indirect contact with animal allergens frequently causes sensitisation.
Rat allergens found in dust, urine, epithelium and saliva are a frequent cause of asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, mainly in laboratory workers but also in ordinary individuals.
Mesoporphyrin is produced by gastrointestinal bacteria and contributes to total fecal porphyrin levels.
Dopamine, a chemical naturally produced in the body, functions in the brain as a neurotransmitter, activating dopamine receptors.
It is also a neurohormone released by the hypothalamus.
As a hormone, it inhibits the release of prolactin from the anterior lobe of the pituitary.
Dopamine can also be supplied as a medication to target the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure.
Because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, however, when given as a drug it does not directly affect the central nervous system.
To increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Dopa-Responsive Dystonia, a synthetic precursor to dopamine such as L-DOPA can be given, since this will cross the blood-brain barrier.
Parovovirus causes Fifth disease - highly contagious pediatric disease that is minimally symptomatic.

Systemic candidiasis is an invasive yeast infection caused primarily by C. albicans, although other Candida species can also be the cause.
It leads to septicemia, endocarditis, meningitis, and rarely as osteomyelitis.
Superficial candidiasis is common, but generally only immunocompromised patients have systemic candidiasis.
Because Candida species are common contaminants, diagnosis is difficult and requires the elimination of other possible causes.
The testing of corticotropin, a pituitary function, is useful in the diagnosis of Cushings syndrome, Addison's disease, ectopic ACTH syndrome and adrenal carcinoma.
Decenoylcarnitine is a primary marker for Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and Glutaric acidemia type II.

There are 2 common species of Kiwi commercially available: A. chinensis - Gold kiwi and A. deliciosa - Green kiwi.
The most common symptoms attributed to Kiwi allergy are those associated with oral allergy syndrome, which include pruritis of the eyes, ears, tongue, pharynx and mouth, and swelling of the lips, tongue and pharynx.
Clam is closely related to quahogs and cockles.
The Manilla clam, also referred to as littleneck clam or carpet shell, is a hard shell clam cultivated on a very large scale in, for example, Japan, and then frozen whole and exported widely.
It is commonly used around the world, for instance, in clam sauce for pasta or just steamed.
This clam is closely related to quahogs and cockles and cross-reactivity to other bivalves cannot be excluded.
Occupational asthma and food allergy caused by clam have been reported.
A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity specific for HIV-1.
The HTT gene (huntingtin) is located on chromosome 4p16.3.
Huntingtin is a disease gene linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons.
This is thought to be caused by an expanded, unstable trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, which translates as a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product.
A fairly broad range in the number of trinucleotide repeats has been identified in normal controls, and repeat numbers in excess of 40 have been described as pathological.
The huntingtin locus is large, spanning 180 kb and consisting of 67 exons.
The huntingtin gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development.
It is expressed as 2 alternatively polyadenylated forms displaying different relative abundance in various fetal and adult tissues.
The larger transcript is approximately 13.7 kb and is expressed predominantly in adult and fetal brain whereas the smaller transcript of approximately 10.3 kb is more widely expressed.
The genetic defect leading to Huntington's disease may not necessarily eliminate transcription, but may confer a new property on the mRNA or alter the function of the protein.
One candidate is the huntingtin-associated protein-1, highly expressed in brain, which has increased affinity for huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamine repeats.
This gene contains an upstream open reading frame in the 5' UTR that inhibits expression of the huntingtin gene product through translational repression.
A mitosporic fungal genus and an anamorphic form of Arthroderma.
Various species attack the skin, nails, and hair.
Granulomatous prostatitis is a rare, usually non-specific granulomatous process that presents as a hard nodule.

Pheniramine (trade name Avil, among others) is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties used to treat allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria.
It has relatively strong sedative effects, and may sometimes be used off-label as an over-the-counter sleeping pill in a similar manner to other sedating antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.
Pheniramine is also commonly found in eyedrops used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.
Pheniramine is generally sold in combination with other medications, rather than as a stand-alone drug, although some formulations are available containing pheniramine by itself.
The ninth most abundant element in the earth's crust, is widely distributed and mainly used in the aircraft and chemical industries for its corrosion-resistant properties.
Main sources of environmental contamination are combustion of fossil fuels and the incineration of titanium-containing wastes.
Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract takes place, but the extent is unknown.
Usually the highest titanium concentrations are in the lungs, followed by the kidney and liver.
There is no evidence that titanium is an essential element for man or animals.
Animal and human studies have shown that titanium in implants and prostheses is extremely well tolerated by osseous and soft tissues.
Titanium compounds have been used in various dermatological formulations, without any known adverse effects; however, exposure appears to induce various levels of slight pulmonary fibrosis.
Titanium dioxide is also often used in lung clearance studies where a biologically inert substance is needed.

It is an autoantigen of type 1 diabetes.
This is NOT the same as pancreatic islet cell.
Studies on type-1 diabetic patient's relatives found that the development of one or more islet autoantibodies (including IA-2 antibody) was an early indicator of the relatives' progression to type-1 diabetes.
Autoantibody profiles identifying patients destined to develop type-1 diabetes are usually detectable before age three.
One study found that for relatives seropositive for IA-2 antibody, the likelihood of developing type-1 diabetes mellitus within five-years was 65.3%.
Some type-1 diabetic patients are originally diagnosed as having type-2 diabetes due to symptom onset in adulthood, societal obesity, and initial insulin-independence.
Detection of one or more islet auto-antibodies (including IA-2) may be used to distinguish these patients with "latent autoimmune diabetes" from type-2 diabetics.
The first example of anti-Doa, reactive with 64% of the Caucasian population, was reported by Swanson et al. in 1965.
It was not until 1972 that Molthan et al. reported the antithetical antibody anti-Dob.
Thus, the Dombrock blood group system was defined and was estimated to be the fifth most useful blood group marker in Caucasians.
However, limited examples of both antibodies greatly restricted broad investigations.
The Dombrock system remained a simple two allele system until 1992, when Banks et al. reported that the red cells of the rare Gy(a-) Hy(a-) Jo(a-) individuals were also Do(a-b-).
Consequently, these three high incidences blood factors were included within the system.
Interestingly, it had already been known that all Gy(a-) red cells lacked both Hya and Joa antigens and that Hy(a-) red cells lacked Joa antigens.
Ironically, Swanson reported the first examples of both anti-Doa (in 1965) and anti-Gya (1967) but as anti-Dob was, at that time, yet to be discovered any association with Doa and Gya could not be deduced.

Xanthines are a group of alkaloids that are commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in treating the symptoms of asthma.
Their effects, however, are widespread and their therapeutic range is narrow and so they are not the drug of choice in asthma treatment.
Methylated xanthine derivatives include caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine (found mainly in chocolate).
These drugs inhibit phosphodiesterase and antagonise adenosine.
The core compound, xanthine, is a product on the pathway of purine degradation and is converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme.
Some people lack sufficient xanthine oxidase, and thus xanthine cannot be converted to uric acid.
This rare genetic disorder is called xanthinuria.
Xanthines are purine derivatives and found very rarely in constituents of nucleic acids.

Essential fatty acids, (EFAs) are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them.
The term "essential fatty acid" refers to fatty acids required for biological processes but does not include the fats that only act as fuel.
Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils, which are "essential" in the sense of being a concentrated essence.
Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).
Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as "conditionally essential," meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions; examples include docosahexaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).
Direct or indirect contact with bird (Budgerigar, Budgie, Parakeet) allergens frequently causes sensitization.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) risk refers to the fetus's risk of being affected by PWS.
The risk for the fetus can be derived from the general population risk as well as prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.
PWS is caused by the functional loss of several genes on chromosome 15.
Normally, only the paternal copy of these genes is active due to genomic imprinting, and in PWS, the paternal copy of these genes is missing.
The genetic basis for PWS is the inverse of the basis for Angelman syndrome, in which the maternal copy of a specific gene on chromosome 15 is missing.
About 70% of PWS cases are due to the deletion of a portion of the paternal chromosome 15, and another 25% are due to the presence of two maternal chromosome 15 copies (called uniparental disomy, meaning two copies from one parent) instead of one maternal and one paternal.
PWS is associated with different characteristics over time.
Infants with PWS have poor growth, developmental delay, and weak muscle tone.
Children with PWS develop a compulsion to eat, which leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PWS is associated with mild to moderate cognitive delay, behavior problems, characteristic facial features, and delayed puberty.
The general population risk of PWS is about 1 in 10,000 - 30,000 live births, and does not change with maternal age.

Hydrogen breath test using lactose is performed to diagnose a lactose malabsorption.
A pre dose reading of hydrogen levels is collected.
The patient is then given a small amount of pure lactose (typically 20 to 25 g), and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours.
If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a lactose malabsorber.
If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive.
If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value.
However, recent study suggest that testing may not correlate with any actual diagnosis.

Trisomy 13 risk refers to the fetus's risk of having trisomy 13.
The risk can be estimated based on maternal age as well as prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.
Trisomy 13, also called Patau syndrome, is caused by the presence of three copies of chromosome 13 in each cell rather than two.
Patau syndrome is associated with severe cognitive delay, various forms of congenital heart disease, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, hypotonia, cleft lip and/or palate, and poorly developed eyes.
Many liveborn infants with Patau syndrome die within the first weeks of life, and less than 10% survive longer than one year.
The general population risk of Trisomy 13 is about 1 in 16,000 live births, but the risk increases with increasing maternal age.

The TNNT3 gene (troponin T3, fast skeletal type) is located on chromosome 11p15.5.
The binding of Ca(2+) to the trimeric troponin complex initiates the process of muscle contraction.
Increased Ca(2+) concentrations produce a conformational change in the troponin complex that is transmitted to tropomyosin dimers situated along actin filaments.
The altered conformation permits increased interaction between a myosin head and an actin filament which, ultimately, produces a muscle contraction.
The troponin complex has protein subunits C, I, and T. Subunit C binds Ca(2+) and subunit I binds to actin and inhibits actin-myosin interaction.
Subunit T binds the troponin complex to the tropomyosin complex and is also required for Ca(2+)-mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase activity.
There are 3 different troponin T genes that encode tissue-specific isoforms of subunit T for fast skeletal-, slow skeletal-, and cardiac-muscle.
This gene encodes fast skeletal troponin T protein; also known as troponin T type 3.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding additional distinct troponin T type 3 isoforms.
A developmentally regulated switch between fetal/neonatal and adult troponin T type 3 isoforms occurs.
Additional splice variants have been described but their biological validity has not been established.

A turkey is either one of two species of large birds in the genus Meleagris.
Turkeys are birds classed in the gamebird order.
As with many galliform species, the female is smaller than the male, and much less colorful.
With their wingspans of 1.5-1.8 meters, the turkeys are by far the largest birds in the open forests in which they live, and are rarely mistaken for any other species.
The two species are the North American Wild Turkey (M. gallopavo) and the Central American Ocellated Turkey (M. ocellata).
The modern domesticated turkey was developed from the Wild Turkey.
The Ocellated Turkey was probably also domesticated by the Mayans.
It has been speculated that this species is more tractable than its northern counterpart, and was the source of the present domesticated stock, but there is no morphological evidence to support this theory.
Aggregate reticulocytes are less mature and mature into punctate over the course of about 36 hours.
From a biological standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life that set it apart from other substances.
It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication.
All known forms of life depend on water.
Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes within the body.
Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism.
In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information).
In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes).
Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes.
Therefore, without water, these metabolic processes would cease to exist, leaving us to muse about what processes would be in its place, such as gas absorption, dust collection, etc.

Antigen found in cytoplasm
Hypersegmented neutrophils are neutrophils with 5 or more nuclear lobes.
They are often seen in disorders of nuclear maturation and are thought to be pathognomonic of the class of anemias called megaloblastic anemias.
Some studies, however, have strongly associated neutrophil hypersegmentation with iron deficiency anemia.
One of the earliest changes in the megaloblastic processes is the appearance of these hypersegmented neutrophils.
Because of the short life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal cells characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia.
However, such neutrophils are not seen in the other classes of anemias, which incidently are far more common than megaloblastic anemias.
It is of note that pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia, and as such, may show hypersegemented neutrophils.
The hamster zona-free ovum test (HZFO test), or hamster test is a method for diagnosing male infertility due to the inability of the sperm to penetrate the ova.
This test has limited value for most people experiencing infertility.
In this test, sperm are incubated with several hamster eggs that have had the outer membranes removed.
After seven to twenty hours, the number of sperm penetrations per egg is measured.
Having all eggs have been penetrated by multiple sperm is considered to be a positive sign for fertility.
Results suggest that men whose sperm fail the hamster test are three times less fertile than those whose sperm pass.
Donated sperm and ICSI techniques are considered more strongly for those whose sperm fail this test.

The ITPA gene on chromosome 20q13 encodes the protein inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase, which hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) and deoxyinosine triphosphate.
Variants in the ITPA gene lead to inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase deficiency (ITPAD),which is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of ITP in erythrocytes.
The accumulation of ITP can be beneficial in that it can substitute for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in a reaction that leads to ATP production.
ITPA gene polymorphisms have been associated with anemia in patients with Hepatitis C who are on antiviral therapy with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribivarin (RBV).
For rs1127354 (ITPA gene g.9330C>A), patients with the wild type CC genotype were more likely to develop anemia and had faster declines in hemoglobin compared to those with C/A or A/A genotypes.
Similarly, patients with the wild type AA genotype at rs7270101 (ITPA gene g.9381A>C) were more likely to experience a drop in hemoglobin compared to those with the A/C or C/C genotypes.

Methemoglobin is a form of the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin, in which the iron in the heme group is in the Fe3+ state, not the Fe2+ of normal hemoglobin.
Metheomglobin appears blue and is unable to carry oxygen.
The NADH-dependent enzyme methemoglobin reductase (AKA diaphorase I) is responsible for converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.
Normally 1-2% of people's hemoglobin is methemoglobin, a higher percentage than this can be genetic or caused by exposure to various chemicals and depending on the level can cause health problems.
A higher level of methemoglobin will tend to cause a pulse oximeter to read closer to 85% regardless of the true level of oxygen saturation.
Methemoglobinemia can be caused by genetic abnormalities such as diaphorase
I deficiency, or abnormal hemoglobin variants.
It can also be caused by certain oxidizing drugs (benzocaine), antibiotics (trimethoprim or sulfanamides), analine dyes, metoclopramide, chlorates, bromates, and nitrates.
Infants under 6 months are particularly susceptible when exposed to nitrates, benzocaine, or even dehydration.
Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue.

Celery is a herbaceous edible biennial plant in the family Apiaceae.
It is native to the coasts of western and northern Europe, and of the Middle East.
It was used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as a flavouring.
The ancient Chinese used it as a medicine.
Celery can cause oral symptoms (aphthae, stomatitis, swelling of the lips or tongue, pharyngitis, hoarseness and laryngeal oedema) and can often also induce acute generalised symptoms, such as severe laryngeal oedema, bronchial asthma, urticaria or allergic shock.
Oral allergy syndrome has been documented (35,107), and the symptoms have been reported to be more marked in severity compared to reactions to other vegetables.

NCF1 gene encodes the neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (NCF1) protein.
NCF1 is a subunit of a group of proteins that comprise the enzyme NADPH oxidase.
NADPH plays an important role in regulating neutrophil activity and in helping phagocytes neutralize bacteria and fungi.
In addition, NADPH helps moderate the inflammatory response that may otherwise cause excessive damage to the body.
When microorganisms infect the body, they stimulate phagocytes to assemble NADPH oxidase, which is critical to the chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a superoxide.
The superoxide is instrumental in producing antibiotic chemicals including hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid.
Mutations in the NCF1 gene affect NCF1 protein production and/or function, which prevents the assembly and function of NADPH.
Twenty-five percent patients with chronic granulomatous disease have mutations in the NCF1 gene, and NCF1 deletions are associated with Williams syndrom.

Hydrogen breath test using fructose is performed to diagnose a fructose malabsorption.
A pre dose reading of hydrogen levels is collected.
The patient is then given a small amount of fructose, and then required to take readings every 15, 30 or 60 minutes for two to three hours.
The basis of the test is a failure to absorb the given sugar, which is then metabolized by bacteria that give off either hydrogen or methane.
Therefore, the more gas that is produced, the less absorption has occurred.
If the level of hydrogen rises above 20 ppm (parts per million) over the lowest preceding value within the test period, the patient is typically diagnosed as a fructose malabsorber.
If the patient produces methane then the parts per million for the methane typically rises 12 ppm over the lowest preceding value to be considered positive.
If the patient produces both hydrogen and methane then the values are typically added together and the mean of the numbers is used to determine positive results, usually 15 ppm over the lowest preceding value.

T-ALLs occur in both adult and pediatric patients and account for 15-25% of ALLs in both patient populations.
Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is an easily absorbed colored micronutrient with a key role in maintaining health in humans and animals.
It is the central component of the cofactors Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and is therefore required by all flavoproteins.
As such, vitamin B2 is required for a wide variety of cellular processes.
It plays a key role in energy metabolism, and for the metabolism of fats, ketone bodies, carbohydrates, and proteins.
A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (poor vitamin sources in one's daily diet) or secondary (e.g. a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine, the body not being able to use the vitamin, or an increase in the excretion of the vitamin from the body).
Signs and symptoms of riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis) include cracked and red lips, inflammation of the lining of mouth and tongue, mouth ulcers, cracks at the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis), and a sore throat.
A deficiency may also cause dry and scaling skin, fluid in the mucous membranes, and iron-deficiency anemia.

Tests such as the prothrombin time (PT) and activated prothromin time (aPTT) can predict bleeding or be used for haemostasis management, but it is difficult to determine which part of the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway is disrupted in an individual.
Since these tests are performed on platelet-poor plasma, they do not provide a true representation of the physiological clotting process so they do no provide adequate information on either clot formation over time or fibrinolysis.
(Young et al, 2013).
Clotting time (CT) is the time for a clot to reach an amplitude of 2 mm.
Clot formation time (CFT) is the time for clot firmness to incease from 2mm (CT) to 20 mm.
A prolonged CFT is usually caused by poor platelet function, low platelet count, fibrin polymerization disorders or fibrinogen deficiency.
Higher concentrations of heparin can also prolong CFT in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM.
A low CFT indicates hypercoagulability.

Natural killer cells are lymphocytes that identify and lyse tumor cells and cells infected with microbes.
The ability of NK cells to recognize cells as foreign is dependent upon inhibitory and activating receptors on the target cells.
The inhibitory receptors distinguish between normal and tumor or infected cells by the presence or absence of the major histocompatibility complex class I.
The activating receptors are NKp46, NKp30, NKp44 and NKG2D.
In addition to their cytolytic function in the innate immune system, NK cells also function to regulate reciprocal interaction with dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells and endothelial cells and thereby affect immune response.

The level of NK cell functionality is determined by various methods, including flow cytometry and chrominum-release assays.
The chromium-release assay uses titrations of effector cells (that are assumed to be NK cells) that are incubated with the target cells.
The level of chromium released by the target cells is then divided by the corrected level of chromium measured in the positive control to assess percent cytotoxicity.
The flow cytometric methods measure cell-mediated immunity, particularly based on uptake of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) or propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V binding, to assess percent cytotoxicity of target cells by effector cells.

CD47 (Cluster of Differentiation 47) is a human protein encoded by the CD47 gene.
This gene encodes a membrane protein, which is involved in the increase in intracellular calcium concentration that occurs upon cell adhesion to extracellular matrix.
The encoded protein is also a receptor for the C-terminal cell binding domain of thrombospondin, and it may play a role in membrane transport and signal transduction.
This gene has broad tissue distribution, and is reduced in expression on Rh erythrocytes.
Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.
Isoform 2 and 4 are the most abundant.
Other than thrombospondin, CD47 also binds CD172a.
CD47 deficient mice have been generated.
Their reported phenotype is a defect in cellular migration of the CD172a expressing cells, suggesting that CD47 to CD172a interactions are necessary for the proper distribution of these cell types.

The WT1 gene (Wilms tumor 1) is located on chromosome 11p13.
This gene encodes a transcription factor that contains four zinc-finger motifs at the C-terminus and a proline/glutamine-rich DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus.
It has an essential role in the normal development of the urogenital system, and it is mutated in a small subset of patients with Wilm's tumors.
This gene exhibits complex tissue-specific and polymorphic imprinting pattern, with biallelic, and monoallelic expression from the maternal and paternal alleles in different tissues.
Multiple transcript variants have been described.
In several variants, there is evidence for the use of a non-AUG (CUG) translation initiation site upstream of and in-frame with the first AUG.
Authors of PMID:7926762 also provide evidence that WT1 mRNA undergoes
RNA editing in human and rat, and that this process is tissue-restricted and developmentally regulated.
The spontaneous clot formation time (Tsp) is the time from the beginning of the assay to time at which the average area of spontaneous clots comprises at least five percent of the overall sample area.
This clotting parameter characterizes clotting that is independent of the activator surface; under normal conditions, no spontaneous clotting is observed.
Scallops, or fan shells, are found in all seas, both shallow and deep.
There is some cross reactivity between crustaceans and mollusks.
Allergic reactions include urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal distress, asthma, rhinitis, and anaphylaxis, and also severe allergic reactions, requiring emergency treatment.
Sera shows IgE activity to a 38kD protein present in boiled muscle extracts of all mollusks, and these results suggest that the heat-stable 38kD protein is the major cross-reactive allergen present in crustaceans and mollusks, identified as the muscle protein tropomyosin.
Immunoblot inhibitions have demonstrated up to 28% bi-directional cross-reactivity between shrimp and scallops, further confirming the major cross-reactive antigen as the respective tropomyosins of shrimps and scallops.
It has been noted that many patients allergic to shrimp do not show clinical hypersensitivity reactions to mollusks or other seafood, indicating the existence of genus specific antigens.
The allergen code is f338.
The concentration of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid (Alpha-Phenyl-2-Piperidine acetate), its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum or whole blood in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage
Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Strongyloides nematodes (roundworms), that enter the body through exposed skin, such as bare feet.
It is most common in tropical or subtropical climates.
Two species of Strongyloides infect humans, S. stercoralis and S. fuelleborni.
Most people do not know they are infected and have no symptoms.
Others may develop a severe form and, if untreated, become critically ill and potentially die.
Symptoms include; stomachache, bloating, and heartburn, intermittent episodes of diarrhea and constipation, nausea and loss of appetite, dry cough, throat irritation, an itchy, red rash that occurs where the worm entered the skin, and recurrent raised red rash typically along the thighs and buttocks.
Rarely, severe life-threatening forms of the disease called hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis can occur.
These forms of the disease are more common in people who are on corticosteroids (prednisone for example) or other immunosuppressive therapies.
The identification of mature and immature granulocytes, including myelocytes and metamyelocytes, in blood and bone marrow is fundamental to the diagnosis of haematological disorders.
A myelocyte is a young cell of the granulocytic series, occurring normally in bone marrow, but not in circulating blood (except when caused by certain diseases).
Myelocytes are derived from promyelocytes and give rise to metamyelocytes.
When stained with the usual dyes, the cytoplasm in myelocytes is distinctly basophilic and relatively more abundant than in myeloblasts or promyelocytes.
Numerous cytoplasmic granules are present in the more mature forms of myelocytes.
Neutrophilic and eosinophilic granules are peroxidase-positive, while basophilic granules are not.
The nucleus of a myelocyte is fairly regular in contour (not indented), and seems to be 'buried' beneath the numerous cytoplasmic granules.
If the nucleus were indented, it is likely be a metamyelocyte.
Arterial pulse wave velocity, such as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), is a reflection of arterial stiffness, and aortic PWV may be a marker of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension, diabetes and end-stage renal disease.
PWV is calculated as the distance traveled between two arterial pulse measurement sites, such as the carotid and femoral arteries, divided by the time it takes for a single pulse wave to travel between the two sites.
A mycotoxin is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by an organism of the fungus kingdom, including mushrooms, molds, and yeasts.]
The term 'mycotoxin' is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops.
Most fungi are aerobic (use oxygen) and are found almost everywhere in extremely small quantities due to the minute size of their spores.
They consume organic matter wherever humidity and temperature are sufficient.
One mold species may produce many different mycotoxins and/or the same mycotoxin as another species.

Peak velocity of blood flow in the aorta.
The activated clotting time (ACT) measures the time to clot formation after addition of an activator, and is used primarily to monitor a patient's coagulation status during surgery, especially procedures during which patients are on cardiopulmonary bypass.
The activator may stimulate the intrinsic and/or extrinsic coagulation pathway, and commonly used activators include kaolin, Celite and glass beads.
Various anticoagulant drugs can be used to prevent clot formation and consumption of platelets during surgery.
The most common is unfractionated heparin because it has a short half-life and is easily reversed.
Baseline ACT and subsequent ACT measurements during and after the procedure help determine the initial heparin dose and titration parameters to achieve a stable level of anticoagulation during surgery, as well as appropriate reversal of anticoagulation after surgery.
The ACT can be affected by platelet count, platelet function, temperature of the blood, and acquired or inherited hematologic conditions.
The ACT is a point of care test used to monitor patients receiving high doses of heparin in an acute setting, while partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is used to monitor patients who are on lower, long-term therapeutic doses of heparin.
The M204I mutations are associated with Lamivudine, Telbivudine and Tenofovir resistance

Fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein that was first isolated from horse plasma in 1876.
Fibrinogen is produced in the liver and constitutes 5% of the total plasma protein.
It is vital to wound healing, fibrinolysis, inflammation, cellular and matrix interactions and neoplasia by interacting with numerous proteins and cells.
Fibrinogen activates a series of clotting factors in response to an injury or other stimuli that leads to the enzymatic conversion of soluble fibrinogen into fibrin.
Fibrin is the insoluble, structural component of blood clots.
Fibrinogen is an acute phase reactant that can increase 200-400% in response to infection, chronic inflammation, smoking and other environmental stresses.
The human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B;) plays an important role in how the immune system recognizes and responds to pathogens.
HLA-B belongs to a class of molecules that are found on the surface of most cells.
These molecules are responsible for presenting peptides to immune cells.
Peptides derived from normal human proteins are recognized as such, whereas foreign peptides derived from pathogens trigger an immune response.
Antiepileptics with an aromatic ring, for example carbamazepine and phenytoin, interact with HLA-B*31:01 and alter the repertoire of self peptides that are presented to T lymphocytes, which activates an immune reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
The APP gene (amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein) is located on chromosome 21q21.3.

The domesticated so-called Belgian Hare, on the other hand, is a Rabbit.
Monoblasts are normally found in bone marrow and do not appear in the normal peripheral blood.
They mature into monocytes, which, in turn, develop into macrophages.
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone synthesized and secreted by gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland.
In the ovary FSH stimulates the growth of immature Graafian follicles to maturation.
As the follicle grows it releases inhibin, which shuts off the FSH production.
In men, FSH enhances the production of androgen-binding protein by the Sertoli cells of the testes and is critical for spermatogenesis.
FSH and LH act synergistically in reproduction.
Palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46.
Meconium is the earliest stools of an infant.
Unlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile, and water.
Meconium is almost sterile and, unlike later feces, is viscous and sticky like tar, and has no odor.
It should be completely over after a few days, with the stools progressing toward yellow (digested milk).
The term meconium derives from meconium-arion, meaning "opium-like", in reference either to its tarry appearance or to Aristotle's belief that it induces sleep in the fetus.
EEG signal quality index (SQI) reflects the quality of the EEG signal based on impedance measurement and is calculated at a particular moment in time based on measurements taken in the immediately preceding time period, such as 60 to 90 seconds.
The signal quality is taken into account when calculating certain EEG variables, such as the bispectral index, and interpreting EEG results.
The ability of an infant to survive outside the uterus is dependent on proper pulmonary function.
Pulmonary surfactant is needed to reduce the surface tension of the air-liquid interface of the alveolar lining, so that alveoli do not collapse upon expiration.
Infants born with a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant are at increased risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
The incidence of RDS is dependent on the gestational age, with more RDS occurring in younger fetuses.

Magnesium salts are essential in nutrition, being required for the activity of many enzymes, especially those concerned with oxidative phosphorylation.
Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body.
It is a component of both intra- and extracellular fluids and is excreted in the urine and feces.
Deficiency causes irritability of the nervous system with tetany, vasodilatation, convulsions, tremors, depression, and psychotic behavior.
Magnesium ion in large amounts is an ionic laxative, and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) is sometimes used for this purpose.
So-called "milk of magnesia" is a water suspension of one of the few insoluble magnesium compounds, magnesium hydroxide; the undissolved particles give rise to its appearance and name.
Milk of magnesia is a mild base, and is commonly used as an antacid.
Neurofilaments (Nfs) are the dominant proteins of the axonal cytoskeleton and are composed of 3 subunits, a light (NfL, 68-70 kDa), a medium (NfM, 145-160 kDa) and a heavy (NfH, 200-220 kDa) chain.
They are CNS cell-type specific proteins and potential markers for axonal injury, disintegration and loss in conditions such as multiple sclerosis.
Tri a aA/TI is an alpha amylase/trypsin inhibitor that can result in allergic reactions by ingesting or inhaling wheat.
The AGL gene (amylo-alpha-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase) is located on chromosome 1p21.
This gene encodes the glycogen debrancher enzyme which is involved in glycogen degradation.
This enzyme has two independent catalytic activities which occur at different sites on the protein: a 4-alpha-glucotransferase activity and a amylo-1,6-glucosidase activity.
Mutations in this gene are associated with glycogen storage disease although a wide range of enzymatic and clinical variability occurs which may be due to tissue-specific alternative splicing.
Alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.
Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is an acute phase reactant that is constantly being produced by hepatocytes to maintain a plasma level of 5-15 ug/mL. When an acute phase response is initiated, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are released by monocytes and macrophages and together induce the synthesis of large amounts of LBP, raising its plasma concentration to 200 ug/mL. When gram-negative bacterial infection occurs, the innate immune system recognizes the glycolipid outer membrane of the bacteria called lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
LBP strongly binds to LPS and transfers it to the cellular LPS receptor made up of CD14 and Toll-like receptor-4.
The presence of LBP with low concentrations of LPS speeds up the release of cytokines earlier in the infection process.
The main role of LBP is to initiate an inflammatory response even when the level of LPS is still low.
Another way that LBP is important is that it catalyzes the movement of LPS to aggregates of high density lipoprotein particles which neutralize LPS.
Wall pellitory is a common weed around the Mediterranean and along the West coast of Europe as far north as central England.
It is found in Spain, Greece, Italy and Israel, and has been introduced in other parts of Western Europe and in Australia and Argentina.

It is strictly parasitic and often pathogenic causing FURUNCULOSIS in SALMONIDS and ulcer disease in GOLDFISH.
Phenylpyruvic acid is a keto-acid that is an intermediate or catabolic byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism.
It has a slight honey-like odor.
Levels of phenylpyruvate are normally very low in blood or urine.
High levels of phenylpyruvic acid can be found in the urine of individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU).
PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid.
In particular, excessive phenylalanine can be metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate.
Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine.
In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid.
Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine.
If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions.
Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life.
A "musty or mousy" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed.
The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis.
In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT).
Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter.
Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain.
But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.
Equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), is a species within the genus Aphthovirus and family Picornaviridae.
ERAV contains a single serotype, equine rhinitis A virus 1 (ERAV-1, formerly known as equine rhinovirus 1).
ERAVs are thought to be a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract disease in horses
CD64, also known as Fc gamma receptor I, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the large immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily.
CD64 is encoded by 3 genes (FCÎ³RI A-C), one for the transmembrane region and the other 2 for the Ig-like domains.
CD64 is consitutively expressed on monocytes and macrophages (but inducible on neutrophils), and it has a pivotal role in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and clearance of immune complexes.
The presence of this molecule on neutrophils can aid in the diagnosis of infection and sepsis, and immuotherapeutic agents targeting CD64 have emerged as candidates for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune disorders .
Salicyluric acid is an aryl glycine conjugate formed by the body to eliminate excess salicylates, including aspirin.
Aspirin is rapidly hydrolysed to salicylic acid which is further metabolized to various compounds, including salicyluric acid (SU) as well as various acyl and phenolic glucuronides, and hydroxylated metabolites.
SU is the major metabolite of SA excreted in urine and it is present in the urine of people who have not taken salicylate drugs, although it has no anti-inflammatory effects in humans or in animals.
More salicyluric acid (SU) is excreted in the urine of vegetarians than in non-vegetarians, primarily because fruits and vegetables are important sources of dietary salicylates.
However, significantly less (10-15X) SU is excreted by vegetarians than individuals taking low-dose aspirin.
The induction of the salicyluric acid formation is one of the saturable pathways of salicylate elimination.
The formation of the methyl ester of salicyluric acid is observed during the quantitation of salicyluric acid and other salicylate metabolites in urine by high-pressure liquid chromatography.
This methyl ester formation causes artificially low values for salicyluric acid and high values for salicylic acid.

Allantoin is a chemical compound with formula C4H6N4O3.
It is also called 5-ureidohydantoin or glyoxyldiureide.
It is a diureide of glyoxylic acid.
Named after the allantois, an amniote embryonic excretory organ in which it concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and higher apes, it is a product of oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism.
After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals.
In humans and higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted.
Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients.
In fish, allantoin is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion.
Allantoin is a major metabolic intermediate in many other organisms including plants and bacteria.

Burkholderia is a genus of proteobacteria probably best-known for its pathogenic members: Burkholderia mallei, responsible for glanders, a disease that occurs mostly in horses and related animals; Burkholderia pseudomallei, causative agent of melioidosis; and Burkholderia cepacia, an important pathogen of pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF).
The Burkholderia (previously part of Pseudomonas) genus name refers to a group of virtually ubiquitous gram-negative, motile, obligately aerobic rod-shaped bacteria including both animal/human (see above) and plant pathogens as well as some environmentally-important species.
In particular, B. xenovorans (previously named Pseudomonas cepacia then B. cepacia and B. fungorum) is renowned for their ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
The use of Burkholderia species for agricultural purposes (such as biodegradation, biocontrol and as plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria) is subject to discussions because of possible pathogenic effects in immuno-compromised people (especially CF-sufferers), e.g., hospital acquired infections.
Due to their antibiotic resistance and the high mortality rate from their associated diseases Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei are considered to be potential biological warfare agents, targeting livestock and humans.
Lecithin is mostly a mixture of glycolipids, triglycerides, and phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol).
However, in biochemistry, lecithin is usually used as a synonym for pure phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid which is the major component of a phosphatide fraction which may be isolated from either egg yolk (in Greek lekithos) or soy beans from which it is mechanically or chemically extracted using hexane.
Lecithin is commercially available in high purity as a food supplement and for medical uses.

Macroprolactin is a physiologically inactive form of prolactin found in a small proportion of people.
It is prolactin bound to IgG.
Macroprolactin is important, as some laboratory assays will detect it as prolactin, leading to a falsely elevated prolactin result.
This can lead to a misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia in some people, especially those with other symptoms, such as infertility or menstrual problems.
There are certain chemicals, such as polyethylene glycol, that can be added to remove macroprolactin from a suspicious sample.
The sample can then be re-analysed to see if the prolactin levels are still high.
The gold standard test to diagnose macroprolactin is gel-filtration chromatography.
Ecarin clotting time (ECT) is a laboratory test used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin, an anticoagulant medication which was originally isolated from leech saliva.
Ecarin, the primary reagent in this assay, is derived from the venom of the saw-scaled viper, Echis carinatus.
In the clinical assay, a known quantity of ecarin is added to the plasma of a patient treated with hirudin.
Ecarin activates prothrombin through a specific proteolytic cleavage, which produces meizothrombin, a prothrombin-thrombin intermediate which retains the full molecular weight of prothrombin, but possesses a low level of procoagulant enzymatic activity.
Crucially, this activity is inhibited by hirudin and other direct thrombin inhibitors, but not by heparin.
The ECT is also unaffected by prior treatment with coumadin or the presence of phospholipid-dependent anticoagulants, such as lupus anticoagulant.
Thus, the ECT is prolonged in a specific and linear fashion with increasing concentrations of hirudin.

The edulis part of the Latin name is a reference to the fact that it produces edible shoots.
A drug is any biological substance, synthetic or non-synthetic, that is taken for non-dietary needs.
It is usually synthesized outside of an organism and it must be introduced into an organism to trigger its effect.
Note that natural endogenous biochemicals (such as hormones) can bind to the same receptors and produce the same effect as a drug.
Thus, a drug is simply a definition that helps distinguish whether a molecule is synthesized in vivo or in vitro.
For instance, insulin is a hormone when it is synthesized in vivo by the pancreas but if it is called a drug if it is introduced into the body.
Stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped from one ventricle of the heart during a single beat.
It is the difference between the volume at the end of diastole, at which point the ventricle is done filling and is at its maximum volume (also known as maximum end-diastolic volume), and the end of systole, at which point the ventricle has finished pumping but has not yet started filling (also known as minimum end-systolic volume).
Tyramine (4-hydroxyphenethylamine; para-tyramine, mydrial or uteramin) is an amino acid derived from the amino acid tyrosine that helps regulate blood pressure.
It occurs naturally in the body and is found in certain foods.
The adrenal glands respond to tyramine by sending catecholamine into the bloodstream, along with dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, providing a boost of energy and, in turn, elevation of blood pressure and heart rate.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) block an enzyme, monoamine oxidase that breaks down excess tyramine.
Blocking this enzyme helps relieve depression.
Most people consume tyramine with no negative side effects, however, people taking MAOIs and other some other medications need to follow a tyramine restricted diet to avoid tyramine build up and dangerous blood pressure spikes.
Tyramine is naturally found in small amounts in protein-containing foods and as these foods age, tyramine levels increase.
Some foods containing tyramine include; strong or aged cheeses, cured meats, smoked or fermented foods (such as sauerkraut, kimchee, caviar, or pickles), sauces (soy sauce, shrimp sauce), and alcoholic beverages such as beer.

Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a colorless amine oxide that is produced from choline, betaine, and carnitine by gut microbial metabolism.
Recently, elevated plasma TMAO levels in humans have been associated with risk for serious adverse cardiovascular incidents and death.
Diet, the composition of gut microbial flora, and liver flavin monooxygenase activity all affect the plasma levels of TMAO.
Foods that contain choline, lecithin, and carnitine, including red meat, eggs, dairy products, and salt-water fish, are sources of TMAO.
TMAO alters cholesterol and bile metabolism, activates inflammatory pathways, and promotes foam cell formation.
It is strongly suspected in mediating the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus.
TMAO also increases with decreasing kidney function, and is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease.
Treatments being explored to lower TMAO include broad-spectrum antibiotics to eliminate TMAO producing bacteria, the promotion of the growth of bacteria that utilize TMAO as a substrate, and the development of target-specific molecules.

There are an estimated 1.5 million species of fungi, of which approximately 140,000 might qualify as Mushrooms, which can mean simply fungi with a large, above-ground fruiting body.
However, there are approximately only 14,000 described species of Mushrooms.
The main types of these Mushrooms are agarics (e.g., the Button mushroom), boletes, chanterelles, tooth fungi, polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi.
"True" Mushrooms are classified as Basidiomycota (also known as club fungi), and have a fruiting body known as a basidiocarp, with the stereotypical umbrella shape.
The morel and truffle are classified as Ascomycota ("sac fungi").
"Toadstool" refers to those Mushrooms with poisonous fruiting bodies, and to other minor macrofungi.

The first antibody in the Knops blood group was found in the serum of an O Rh negative woman who had been multiply transfused in previous surgeries.
Her blood was incompatible with all O negative donor units tested until the blood bank technologist Margaret Helgeson, tested her own blood and found it compatible.
Thus, in a report published in 1970, the antibody was named anti-Kna-Helgeson and the blood group called Knops.
The Helgeson cells were used extensively to test other antibodies with previously unknown specificities.
In 1978, another antibody was identified that was compatible with the Helgeson cells but not the Knops-negative cells and this was named McCoy (McCa).
The next antibody reported for the system was named after the first two antibody producers, ie.
Swain and Langley, thus the designation Sla.
The final antibody identified to a high frequency antigen in the Knops system was found in the serum of Mrs. York and was named Yka.

The herpes simplex virus (HSV) manifests itself in two common viral infections, each marked by painful, watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes (such as the mouth or lips) or on the genitals.
The disease is contagious, particularly during an outbreak, and is incurable with present technology.
An infection on the lips is commonly known as a cold sore or fever blister.
These are sometimes confused with canker sores or aphthous ulcers, which have a similar appearance; these appear inside the mouth and are not caused by the herpes simplex virus.
When not symptomatic HSV lies dormant in nerve cells, growing along the axons of the skin during an outbreak.
When the outbreak has passed, the virus 'dies back' along the nerve until it is only present in the nerve body.
The dormancy of the virus within the nerve bodies contributes to the difficulty of treatment.

It is synthesized as a catalytically-inactive enzyme which is activated and auto-proteolyzed upon acidification.
Mutations in this gene result in late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which is associated with the failure to degrade specific neuropeptides and a subunit of ATP synthase in the lysosome.
Mercury is a naturally occurring metal which has several forms.
The metallic mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid.
If heated, it is a colorless, odorless gas.
Mercury combines with other elements, such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen, to form inorganic mercury compounds or "salts," which are usually white powders or crystals.
Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds.
The most common one, methylmercury, is produced mainly by microscopic organisms in the water and soil.
More mercury in the environment can increase the amounts of methylmercury that these small organisms make.
Metallic mercury is used to produce chlorine gas and caustic soda, and is also used in thermometers, dental fillings, and batteries.
Mercury salts are sometimes used in skin lightening creams and as antiseptic creams and ointments.
For various reasons, the patient origin for a particular specimen may be questioned.
When the patient identity for a specimen (especially paraffin-embedded material) needs to be verified, a panel of 12 microsatellite markers that recognize highly variable regions of human DNA PCR-based assay can be used for identification.
The assay compares the genotype for the specimen in question, with the genotype of the patient specimens of known identity.
Matching genotypes on multiple specimens suggest that they are derived from the same patient, whereas differences in genotype suggest different patient sources.
A previous bone marrow transplant from an allogenic donor will interfere with testing.
When HIV-1 enters a cell it first is changed into an inactive HIV-1 DNA provirus.

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is found in all cells of the body.
Some cholesterol is required to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help digest foods.
The body makes all the cholesterol it needs, however cholesterol also is found in some of the foods.
Cholesterol travels through the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins.
These packages are made of fat (lipid) on the inside and proteins on the outside.
Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout the body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important.
A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in arteries.
HDL cholesterol carries cholesterol from other parts of the body back to the liver where it is removed.

The MBDA algorithm is as follows: PTJC = Prediction of Tender Joint Count = â26.72+3.243 Ã 1/10 â 11.97 Ã 1/10 + 15.72 Ã 1/10 + 0.4594 Ã 1/10 + 3.881 Ã 1/10 + 0.7388 Ã 1/10 â 0.2557 Ã 1/10 + 0.7003 Ã 1/10 PSJC = Prediction of Swollen Joint Count = â26.63 + 3.232 Ã 1/10 â 11.93 Ã 1/10 + 15.67 Ã 1/10 + 0.4578 Ã 1/10 + 3.868 Ã 1/10 + 0.7363 Ã 1/10 â 0.2548
Ã 1/10 + 0.6979 Ã 1/10 PPGS = Prediction of Patient Global Score = -13.489 + 5.474 Ã 1/10 + 0.486 Ã 1/10 + 2.246 Ã 1/10 + 1.684 Ã 1/10 + 4.14 Ã 1/10 + 2.292 Ã 1/10 â 1.898 Ã 1/10 + 0.028 Ã 1/10 â 2.892 Ã 1/10 â 0.506 Ã 1/10 MBDA score = round(max(min((0.56 Ã sqrt(max(PTJC,0))
+ 0.28 Ã sqrt(max(PSJC,0))
+ 0.14 Ã PPGS + 0.36 Ã log(CRP/106 + 1))
Ã 10.53 + 1, 100),1))
The biomarker concentrations in the above formulas are expressed in pg/mL. All concentration values (except CRP) are transformed to the power 1/10 prior to use in the algorithm.
MBDA scores are integers from 1 to 100 where 1 to 29 are considered low disease activity, 30 to 44 are moderate disease activity, and 45 to 100 are high disease activity.
Amorphous head would be defined as an abnormal head shape not otherwise classified with a specific term (such as pyriform, tapering or round).
Tiagabine is an anticonvulsant medication marketed under the brand name Gabitril.
The medication is also used in the treatment of panic disorder, as are a few other anticonvulsants.

Genetic screening for abnormal CYP1A2 metabolism is focused on the presence of *1C (-3860G>A), *1F (163C>A) and *1K (-729C>T) genetic polymorphisms.
Individuals homozygous for *1F have higher CYP1A2 activity in the presence of CYP1A2 inducers.
The *1C and *1K alleles are associated with decreased CYP1A2 activity with intermediate metabolism when 1 allele is present and slow (poor) metabolism when 2 alleles are present.
Inducers for CYP1A2 activity include smoking, coffee, omeprazole, insulin.
Inhibitors include oral contraceptives.
The genotype results may be used to determine a patient's drug dose adjustment.
Barbiturates were first developed in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer and were widely distributed by the Farbwerke Fr Bayer and Co in 1904.
Barbiturates offered new treatment to patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders profoundly improving their prognoses.
Barbiturates were also used to treat sleep disorders and were the first drugs to effectively treat epileptic seizures.
Due to safety concerns related to drug dependence and overdose and new safer psychoactive medications barbiturate use sharply declined in the 1950s.
Pentobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that is used as a sedative, a hypnotic and to induce sleep.
A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group.
This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains.
The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription.
It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS.
Its principal toxic effect is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting in anemia and leukopenia.
Monocyclohexyl methylphosphonate (GF acid) a metabolite of the chemical warfare nerve agent cyclosarin (aka GF).
Cyclosarin or GF (cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is an extremely toxic substance that is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations.

Cyclosarin is more toxic than sarin in humans.
Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are associated with various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, breast cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
CDKN2A gene mutations associated with HNSCC are acquired (somatic) and found only in tumor cells, which occur primarily in the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat.
Most of these mutations result in reduced or non-functional p16(INK4a) protein.
CDKN2A mutations associated with FAMMM syndrome are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and show reduced penetrance and variable expressivity.
Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a single polypeptide chain that is derived from transferrin receptor.
The transferring receptor is mostly expressed on cells that require iron.
sTfR concentration in blood correlates with the density of transferrin receptors on red blood cells (RBCs) and the number of RBCs with transferrin receptors being expressed, which closely correlates to iron requirements and RBC proliferation.
sTfR has been proposed as an alternative marker for anemia of chronic disease (ACD), iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), and mixed ACD+IDA rather than the conventional tests, ferritin and transferrin.
Ferritin and transferrin are both acute-phase reactants and are greatly affected by inflammation, infection and malignancy.
sTfR is not affected by chronic disease or inflammation.
sTfR can distinguish between ADC and IDA because sTfR increases in IDA but not in ACD.
The rs1414334 (c.551-3008C>G) variant located in the HTR1C gene is associated with metabolic syndrome in patients treated with antipsychotics, particularly clozapine or risperidone.
Patients who are carriers of the rs1414334 C allele have been found to have an increased risk for the metabolic syndrome.
L-3-Phenyllactic acid (or PLA) is a chiral aromatic compound involved in phenylalanine metabolism.
It is likely produced from phenylpyruvate via the action of lactate dehydrogenase.
The D-form of this organic acid is typically derived from bacterial sources while the L-form is almost certainly endogenous.
Levels of phenyllactate are normally very low in blood or urine.
High levels of PLA in the urine or blood are often indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA).
PKU is due to lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), so that phenylalanine is converted not to tyrosine but to phenylpyruvic acid (a precursor of phenylactate).
In particular, excessive phenylalanine is typically metabolized into phenylketones through, a transaminase pathway route involving glutamate.
Metabolites of this transamination reaction include phenylacetate, phenylpyruvate and phenethylamine.
In persons with PKU, dietary phenylalanine either accumulates in the body or some of it is converted to phenylpyruvic acid and then to phenyllactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase.
Individuals with PKU tend to excrete large quantities of phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate and phenyllactate, along with phenylalanine, in their urine.
If untreated, mental retardation effects and microcephaly are evident by the first year along with other symptoms which include: unusual irritability, epileptic seizures and skin lesions.
Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life.
A "musty or mousy" odor of skin, hair, sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation); and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema are also observed.
The neural-development effects of PKU are primarily due to the disruption of neurotransmitter synthesis.
In particular, phenylalanine is a large, neutral amino acid which moves across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via the large neutral amino acid transporter (LNAAT).
Excessive phenylalanine in the blood saturates the transporter.
Thus, excessive levels of phenylalanine significantly decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain.
But since these amino acids are required for protein and neurotransmitter synthesis, phenylalanine accumulation disrupts brain development, leading to mental retardation.
Trans fatty acids (also called trans fats, or trans-unsaturated fatty acids) are manufactured fats created during a process called hydrogenation, that is aimed at stabilizing polyunsaturated oils to prevent them from becoming rancid, and to keep them solid at room temperature.
Most trans fat is a monounsaturated (one double bond) fatty acid.
The shape of trans-fat molecules is more like cholesterol-raising saturated fat than a typical monounsaturated fatty acid.
They may be particularly dangerous for the heart and may pose a risk for certain cancers.
Hydrogenated fats are used in stick margarine, fast foods, commercial baked goods (donuts, cookies, crackers), processed foods, and fried foods.
FISH studies are commonly used to identify deletions of chromosome 13q14 and 17p13, which are known to cause chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Deletion of 13q14 is the most common chromosomal aberration in CLL and correlated with favorable prognosis.
Deletion of 17p13 affects the p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53) and has been associated with disease progression and reduced survival.
Identification of these deletions is useful for choosing appropriate therapy for patients.
For example, patients with deletions at 17p13 are resistant to standard therapies, such as fludarabine, but will likely benefit from more aggressive therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation.
Conventional cytogenetics (e.g. karyotyping) detects up to 50% of chromosomal aberrations whereas FISH methods detect up to 80% in patients with CLL.
Urbankova, et al. (2012) showed that a subset of potentially significant genomic aberrations in CLL is being missed by cytogenetics and FISH.
They demonstrated that arrayCGH analysis is robust, highly sensitive and specific and might be useful in routine screening of CLL.
Urbankova, et al., suggested using a combination of conventional cytogentics, FISH and arrayCGH to determine the molecular karyotype of CLL since it is an important indicator of disease prognosis.
Human chromogranin A is a secretory protein (439 amino acids) that is produced by neuroendocrine cells.
It is used chiefly as an immunohistochemical marker for normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine tissues and is observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, carcinoid tumor, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung carcinoma.
Seven neuroendocrine tumors that secrete no other hormone markers, referred to as "nonfunctioning" tumors, can sometimes be detected via the serum levels of chromogranin A. Chromogranin A is more stable than serotonin, making its measurement a useful alternative to 5IHAA for the detection of carcinoid tumor.
Prostate cancer patients with elevated levels of chromogranin A correlate with poor prognosis.
P504S, aka alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR), is a peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzyme that plays a role in bile acid synthesis and Î²-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids.
P504S is overexpressed in human prostate cancer with minimal or no expression in normal prostate.
In IHC testing, P504S is used as a specific marker of prostatic adenocarcinoma.
Prostate glands involved in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) have been found to express P504S, whereas P504S was nearly undetectable in benign glands.
A species of AVIBIRNAVIRUS causing severe inflammation of the bursa of Fabricius in chickens and other fowl.

DOET, HECATE, or 2,5-dimethoxy -4-ethyl amphetamine is an analogue of DOM, and is the three-carbon chain homologue to 2C-E. It produces hallucinogenic, psychedelic, and entheogenic effects.
Urea nitrogen is the waste product formed in the liver when proteins are broken down into their respective amino acids.
Once proteins are metabolized in the liver, urea nitrogen is released from the liver to the kidneys via the bloodstream.
The kidneys then filter the urea nitrogen out of the bloodstream into the urine.
Although the kidneys filter out most of the urea nitrogen in the blood, small traces of stable urea nitrogen remain in circulation.
To evaluate kidney function, a blood urea nitrogen test (BUN test) is conducted.
High amounts of urea nitrogen in the BUN test indicate complications with kidney function or decreased blood flow to the kidneys.
A decrease in urea nitrogen in the BUN test is indicative of severe liver disease or malnutrition.
Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a rickettsial bacterium (formerly known as Ehrlichia phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia equi) that infects white blood cells and causes human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA).
A. phagocytophilum is a pathogen transmitted to humans by the bite of a tick (i.e., American dog tick, deer tick, and Lone Star tick), and may pose a risk of being transmitted by blood transfusion.
The first symptoms of HGE/HGA normally begin one to two weeks after a tick bite, but a negative test for antibodies during the first seven to 10 days of illness is not always accurate.
Both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies usually rise near the end of the first week of illness.
IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive, so a concurrent IgG titer should also be run.
Repeat testing several weeks after the original test, including comparison of antibody titers between the two time periods, is recommended.
For IgG, the first sample typically shows a low or negative result, and the second typically shows a significant (four-fold) increase in IgG antibody levels.
Isofenphos is a colorless oil and organophosphate that is used to control soil-dwelling insects such as white grubs, cabbage root flies, corn roundworms and wireworms.
It is a Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP) that is highly toxic and must have DANGER-POISON printed on its container label.
Isofenphos is an insecticide for vegetables including maize and carrots, for fruits such as bananas, for soils with turfgrass, and for termites in and around buildings.
Symptoms of acute toxicity in humans would likely mimic those of other organophosphates and include: increased secretions, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, urination, pupil contraction, slowness of the heart-very high doses may lead to convulsions and coma.
The primary effect of chronic exposure to isofenphos is the inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase in the circulation which regulates inter-cellular nerve activity.

3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT), also known as 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethylamine, is a metabolite of the neurotransmitter dopamine formed by the introduction of a methyl group to dopamine by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT).
3-MT can be further metabolized by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form homovanillic acid (HVA), which is then typically excreted in the urine.
Originally thought to be inactive, 3-MT has recently been shown to act as an agonist of the TAAR1.
Blast cells are precursors of white blood cells and are normally found in bone marrow.
The presence of blasts in the peripheral blood is a marker for hematologic malignancy.
The Orthomyxoviridae are a family of RNA viruses which infect mainly vertebrates (Thogotovirus in ticks, Isavirus in the sea louse).
This family of viruses includes those which cause influenza.
There are three genera of influenza virus, identified by antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein: Influenzavirus A that has been linked to all flu pandemics and is known to infect humans, other mammals and birds (see also avian influenza); Influenzavirus B, known to infect humans and seals; Influenzavirus C, known to infect humans and pigs.
Known flu pandemics include: the Asiatic (Russian) Flu, 1889-90, 1 million dead, possibly due to strain H2N2; the Spanish Flu, 1918-20, 40 million dead, strain H1N1; the Asian Flu, 1957-58, 1 to 1.5 million dead, strain H2N2; and the Hong Kong Flu, 1968-69, 1 million dead, strain H3N2.
In biochemistry, cholinesterase is a term which refers to one of the two enzymes:Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), also known as RBC cholinesterase, erythrocyte cholinesterase, or (most formally) acetylcholine acetylhydrolase, found primarily in the blood and neural synapses Pseudocholinesterase (BChE or BuChE), also known as plasma cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, or (most formally) acylcholine acylhydrolase, found primarily in the liver Both of these compounds catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation.
The difference between the two types of cholinesterase has to do with their respective preferences for substrates:the former hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly; the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine more quickly.
Perforin-1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PRF1 gene.
Defects in this gene cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 2 (HPLH2), a rare and lethal autosomal recessive disorder of early childhood.
Perforin is a cytolytic protein found in the granules of CD8 T-cells and NK cells.
Upon degranulation, perforin inserts itself into the target cell's plasma membrane, forming a pore.
The lytic membrane-inserting part of perforin is the MACPF domain.
This region shares homology with cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria.
Although purified perforin is sufficient to lyse cells at high doses, the biology of perforin itself does not explain the ability of CD8 T-cells and NK cells to induce apoptosis in target cells.
This induction of apoptosis may require at least one other granule protein, granzyme B.
A genus of tick-borne protozoan parasites that infests the red blood cells of mammals, including humans.
There are many recognized species, and the distribution is world-wide.
A species of bacteria found in the marine environment, sea foods, and the feces of patients with acute enteritis.
Integrin, alpha L (antigen CD11A (p180), lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1; alpha polypeptide), also known as ITGAL, is a human gene.
ITGAL encodes the integrin alpha L chain.
Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain.
This I-domain containing alpha integrin combines with the beta 2 chain (ITGB2) to form the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which is expressed on all leukocytes.
LFA-1 plays a central role in leukocyte intercellular adhesion through interactions with its ligands, ICAMs 1-3 (intercellular adhesion molecules 1 through 3), and also functions in lymphocyte costimulatory signaling.
CD11a is one of the two components, along with CD18, which form lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1.
Efalizumab acts as an immunosuppressant by binding to CD11a.
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) or mycophenolate is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection after solid-organ transplant as well as graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis after hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
MPA is highly bound to albumin and the unbound fraction of MPA is approximately 1â3% of the total.
MPA is glucuronidated in the liver, primarily to an inactive metabolite, mycophenolic acid glucuronide, and partially to an active metabolite, mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide.
Drug levels of MPA and its metabolites are used to adjust drug dosing and monitor patient adherence.
MPA is commonly marketed under the trade names CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil; Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium; Novartis).
A cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complex that acts to induce elongation arrest of nascent presecretory and membrane proteins until the ribosome becomes associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
It consists of a 7S RNA and at least six polypeptide subunits (relative molecular masses 9, 14, 19, 54, 68, and 72K).
T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) are formed as a byproduct of T cell receptor (TCR) generation in the thymus.
Every T cell has a unique TCR, and formation of TCRs involves DNA rearrangement into different combinations of variable, diversity, and joining sequences.
As these combinations are created, the remaining fragments of excised DNA form circular structures, or TRECs.
The number of TRECs is proportional to T cell production, with low TREC numbers being an indicator of inadequate T cell production.
In newborns, dried blood spot TREC analysis is used to screen for severe combined immunodeficiency as well as other disorders associated with low T cell counts, such as DiGeorge syndrome, trisomy 21, CHARGE syndrome, and congenital leukemia.
Union of two cysteine molecules
Alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP) is a key variable in prenatal screening for the detection of trisomy 18, 21 and neural tube defect.
It is also the primary tumor marker for nonseminomatous testicular cancers.
Post-operative AFP levels that remain above normal imply residual tumor, and/or tumor recurrence.
AFP can be high in up to 70% of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
Elevated AFP levels have occasionally been found in association with gastrointestinal tract cancers.
Serum AFP is also elevated in ataxia telangiectasia, hereditary tyrosinemia, teratocarcinoma, and non-cancerous hepatic conditions, such as acute viral hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis.
Elevation of serum AFP in non-cancerous hepatic diseases is usually transient.
The clot density is a measure of the firmness and structure of a fibrin clot.
It reflects the quantity and biological activity of fibrinogen but is not a direct measurement of fibrin concentration.

It is present in South and Center America, the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern and Southern Europe.
Only the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, England and Ireland are not considered to be endemic areas.
This disease is a disease of Equidae (horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras).
Although primarily transmitted to horses by ticks, this bloodborne disease has been spread mechanically from animal to animal by contaminated needles.
Aspergillus oryzae, a filamentous fungi also known as koji, is widely used for the production of sake, miso, and soy sauce.
There are two theories as to the origin of A. oryzae.
One suggests that A. oryzae is a domesticated species not found in nature.
The other, more historical theory, is that it is found in the mold growing on ears of rice.
There is evidence supporting A. oryzae's potential to breaking down biodegradable plastic.
Although there have been few case reports of hypersensitivity pneumonitis secondary to Apergillus oryzae, it has been considered that physicians recognize the potential due to increasing globalization of food production.
CSF IgM, IgA, and IgG indexes are indicators of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.
The calculations incorporate the CSF-serum albumin quotient, an indicator of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) function, in order to differentiate whether the immunoglobulins found in the CSF were produced intrathecally or leaked across the BBB.
These immunoglobulin indexes can be useful in the diagnosis of central nervous system infections, neoplasms and primary neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
They also have the potential to monitor treatment efficacy in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus with CNS involvement, in which one study found that all three indexes decreased significantly along with CNS symptoms during successful treatment.
The CSF IgM index is calculated as (CSF IgM/serum IgM)/(CSF albumin/serum albumin), which can also be represented as (CSF IgM x serum albumin)/(serum IgM x CSF albumin).

Prostaglandin E1 is excreted directly into the urine.
Prostaglandin E1 relaxes the circular muscle of the gut in opposition to Prostaglandin F2a, and also relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter.
Prostaglandin E1 reduces gastric secretion preventing the formation of ulcers.
Prostaglandin E1 is also a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation.
Prostaglandin E1 stimulates accumulation of cyclic AMP and can stimulate thyroid activity in a manner similar to that of TSH.
Elevated levels have been found in patients with tuberculosis, lung cancer, Medullary Carcinoma of the Thyroid, Carcinoid Syndrome, neuroblastomas, and the Watery Diarrhea Syndrome.
Prostaglandin E1 production and circulating levels are drastically suppressed by aspirin and indomethacin.
Sulfur enters the body mainly as the amino acids, cysteine, and methionine.
The major end-product of sulfur metabolism in humans is inorganic sulfate, which is excreted in urine in the free form together with small amounts of its esters with aromatic compounds.
Sulfur is found in all cells.
Skin and nail disease have been associated with an inadequate intake of sulfur containing amino acids.
Psoriasis and rheumatic condition suffers often respond well to increased intakes of these amino acids.
Foods found to high in sulfate include dried fruits, certain commercial breads, soya flour, and sausages.
Beverages high in sulfate include select juices, beers, wines, and ciders.
Parenteral nutrition also includes various formulations of sulfate.
Charcoal is the blackish residue consisting of impure carbon obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and vegetation substances.
Charcoal is usually produced by slow pyrolysis, the heating of wood, sugar, bone char, or other substances in the absence of oxygen (see pyrolysis, char and biochar).
The resulting soft, brittle, lightweight, black, porous material resembles coal and is 85% to 98% carbon with the remainder consisting of volatile chemicals and ash.
Primary hyperoxaluria results from the overproduction of a substance called oxalate, which is excreted in the urine and can lead to stones in the form of calcium oxalate.

Vilazodone was approved by the FDA for use in the United States to treat major depressive disorder on January 21, 2011.
Lactulose is a synthetic sugar used in the treatment of constipation and hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease.
It is a disaccharide (double-sugar) formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose.
The commercial syrup used for treatment of constipation is dyed yellow-orange.
It is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose.
Lactulose is used as a test of small intestine bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBO).
A large amount of it is given with subsequent testing of molecular hydrogen gas in the breath.
The test is positive if an increase in exhaled hydrogen occurs before that which would be expected by normal colonocyte digestion.
An earlier result has been hypothesized to indicate digestion occurring within the small intestine.
An alternate explanation for differences in results is the variance in small bowel transit time among tested subjects

Valine, one of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, is nutritionally essential.
It is named after the plant valerian.
Foods that are good sources of valine include cottage cheese, fish, poultry, peanuts, sesame seeds, and lentils.
In sickle cell disease, the replacement of an A by T in the beta chain gene of hemoglobin changes the codon GAG (for glutamic acid) to GTG (which encodes valine).
Thus valine, a hydrophic amnio acid, replaces glutamic acid, a hydrophilic amino acid, causing hemoglobin to not fold correctly.
It is also a precursor in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway.
Citations include journal articles, textbooks, and other sources that may be cited as a source of information.
The IGH gene (immunoglobulin heavy locus) is located on chromosome 14q32.33.
Immunoglobulins recognize foreign antigens and initiate immune responses such as phagocytosis and the complement system.
Each immunoglobulin molecule consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.
This region represents the germline organization of the heavy chain locus.
The locus includes V (variable), D (diversity), J (joining), and C (constant) segments.
During B cell development, a recombination event at the DNA level joins a single D segment with a J segment; this partially rearranged D-J gene is then joined to a V segment.
The rearranged V-D-J is then transcribed with the IGHM constant region; this transcript encodes a mu heavy chain.
Later in development B cells generate V-D-J-Cmu-Cdelta pre-messenger RNA, which is alternatively spliced to encode either a mu or a delta heavy chain.
Mature B cells in the lymph nodes undergo switch recombination, so that the V-D-J gene is brought in proximity to one of the IGHG, IGHA, or IGHE genes and each cell expresses either the gamma, alpha, or epsilon heavy chain.
Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition.
Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and by somatic hypermutation, which occurs during B cell maturation in the spleen and lymph nodes.
Due to polymorphism, the numbers of functional V, J, and D genes differ among individuals and some V, D, J, and C segments may be pseudogenes.
5-hydroxyindoleacetate (5HIAA) is a metabolite of serotonin and is excreted in the urine.
Serotonin is produced in large amounts by carcinoid tumors.
Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors usually found in the lining of the digestive tract or in the lungs.
The serotonin that is released by the carcinoid tumors is metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the liver, lungs, and brain to 5HIAA.
Testing for elevated levels of 5HIAA in 24 hour urine specimens is 73% sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of carcinoid tumors.
A fasting plasma 5HIAA correlates to a urine 5HIAA and other relevant biomarkers.

Epiandrosterone is a steroid hormone with weak androgenic activity.
It is a natural metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone via the 5-alpha reductase enzyme.
Epiandrosterone has been shown to naturally occur in most mammals.
Epiandrosterone is naturally produced by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase from the adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
Epiandrosterone can also be converted from the natural steroids androstanediol via 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or from androstanedione via 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
Synonyms for epiandrosterone are: 3-epiandrosterone; 3Î²-androsterone; 3Î²-hydroxyetioallocholan-17-one; 5Î±-androstan-17-one, 3Î²-hydroxy-; 5Î²-androstan-17-one; and 3-Î²-hydroxyetiollocholan-17-one
The CALR (calreticulin) gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2.
Calreticulin is a multifunctional protein that acts as a major Ca(2+)-binding (storage) protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.
It is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation.
Calreticulin binds to the synthetic peptide KLGFFKR, which is almost identical to an amino acid sequence in the DNA-binding domain of the superfamily of nuclear receptors.
Calreticulin binds to antibodies in certain sera of systemic lupus and Sjogren patients which contain anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, it is highly conserved among species, and it is located in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum where it may bind calcium.
The amino terminus of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and prevents the receptor from binding to its specific glucocorticoid response element.
Calreticulin can inhibit the binding of androgen receptor to its hormone-responsive DNA element and can inhibit androgen receptor and retinoic acid receptor transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation.
Thus, calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased autoantibody titers against calreticulin but calreticulin is not a Ro/SS-A antigen.
Earlier papers referred to calreticulin as an Ro/SS-A antigen but this was later disproven.
Increased autoantibody titer against human calreticulin is found in infants with complete congenital heart block of both the IgG and IgM classes.
The Ambler classification for carbapenemases utilizes four molecular classes - A, B, C and D. The OXA group of Î²-lactamases occur mainly in Acinetobacter species and are part of molecular class D. The "OXA-like" groups of genes are molecularly similar to and thought to evolve from the original gene for which the group is named.
For example, as of 2014 the blaOXA-23-like group included 19 genes, including including blaOXA-23, -27, -49, and -73..
Many OXA enzymes (OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like, OXA-48-like, OXA-58-like) are considered to be responsible for the worldwide resistance epidemics.
OXA-23-like enzymes have been isolated in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-AB) in both the US and in China, revealing the importance of national and global efforts to control the spread of CR-AB.

It can also be used to treat moderately severe bacterial infections involving the lung, bone, joint, stomach, blood, heart valve, and urinary tract.
It is effective only against infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci bacteria, organisms commonly found on normal human skin.
Resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria.
The nucleosome is the structural unit of chromatin and consists of a segment of dsDNA coiled around a histone core.
Anti-chromatin autoantibodies, such as those found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) fall in to two categories: those directed against individual components of chromatin, such as DNA and histone, and those directed against the intact nucleosome.
Traditionally anti-dsDNA antibodies have been among the ones used for diagnosis and monitoring of SLE, however, studies have shown that for some patients, the nucleosome is the primary antigen in SLE, and anti-nucleosome antibodies may provide a better reflection of disease activity.
A subset of patients who are positive for anti-nucleosome antibodies but negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies may have a milder course of SLE that does not involve the kidneys.
Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PCD) is a rare disorder causing developmental delay and failure to thrive at birth or in early infancy.

In human physiology, base deficit refers to a decrease in the total serum concentration of bicarbonate.
It can be indicative of metabolic acidosis (acidosis describes the abnormal conditions that results from an excess of acid within the blood such as in a case of lactic acidosis due to anaerobic metabolism) or compensatory respiratory alkalosis (alkalosis describes a conditions that results from an excess alkali (base) within the blood).
A base deficit indicates an excess of acid.
It refers to the amount of base needed to titrate a serum pH back to normal (healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7.35 and 7.45) when the contribution of respiratory factors is taken out of the equation.
Base deficit is usually reported as a negative base excess.
Therefore a base excess of -5 is a base deficit of 5.

Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, commonly known as "Alpha Gal" is a carbohydrate found in mammalian meat products.
Bites from the lone star tick have been implicated in the development of a delayed allergic response caused by the consumption of mammalian meat products.
Blood tests for IgE response indicating alpha gal allergy have not been approved by the FDA, but are available and are in use.
The allergy most often occurs in the central and southern United States, which corresponds to the distribution of the lone star tick.
The allergic reaction is delayed-onset, occurring several hours after the consumption of mammalian meat products, instead of the typical rapid onset with most food allergies.
After the delayed onset, the allergic response is typical of an IgE mediated allergy (and most food allergies), including hives, angioedema, gastrointestinal upset, and possible anaphylaxis.
N-Acetylaspartic acid, or N-acetylaspartate (NAA), is a derivative of aspartic acid with a formula of C6H9NO5 and a molecular weight of 175.139.
NAA is the second-most-concentrated molecule in the brain after the amino acid glutamate.
It is synthesized in neurons from the amino acid aspartic acid and acetyl-coenzyme A.
The various functions served by NAA are still under investigation, but the primary proposed functions include its being: 1.A neuronal osmolyte that is involved in fluid balance in the brain 2.A source of acetate for lipid and myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that myelinate neuronal axons 3.A precursor for the synthesis of the important neuronal dipeptide N-Acetylaspartylglutamate 4.A contributor to energy production from the amino acid glutamate in neuronal mitochondria.
In the brain, NAA is thought to be present predominantly in neuronal cell bodies, where it acts as a neuronal marker.
NAA gives off the largest signal in magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the human brain, and the levels measured there are decreased in numerous neuropathological conditions ranging from brain injury to stroke to Alzheimer's disease.
This fact makes NAA a reliable diagnostic molecule for doctors treating patients with brain damage or disease.
NAA may also be a marker of creativity.

Aluminium (Al) is a metal which is distributed throughout our environment.
It has been used since approximately 1887.
Al is widely used in multiple industries and consumer products.
It has no known function in biology.
Al usually enters the human body via cooking utensils or pharmicological agents such as antacids (Al (OH)3 )and antiperspirants.
Aluminum salts are remarkably nontoxic, aluminum sulfate having an LD50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral, mouse), which corresponds to 500 grams for an 80 kg (180 lb) person.
Aluminum is excreted by filtration by the glomeruli of the kidney.
Patients in renal failure lose the ability to clear aluminum, and aluminum toxicity may be a concern.
Aluminum accumulates in the blood and binds to proteins such as albumin, and then distributed throughout the body.
Because aluminum competes with calcium for absorption, increased amounts of dietary aluminum may contribute to the reduced skeletal mineralization (osteopenia) observed in preterm infants and infants with growth retardation.
In very high doses, aluminum is associated with altered function of the blood-brain barrier.
A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminum and experience contact dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminum.
In those without allergies, aluminum is not as toxic as heavy metals, but there is evidence of some toxicity if consumed in amounts greater than 40 mg/day per kg of body mass.
Aluminum is classified as a non-carcinogen by the US Department of Health and Human Services.
In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminum, deferoxamine mesylate may be given to help eliminate it from the body by chelation.
(Tietz: Clinical Guide to Laboratory Tests, Fourth Edition)
The mechanism of how the neurotoxicity of AI occurs is still unclear.
Evidence suggests that oxidative stress and inflammatory processes lead to cell death.

Fibronectin is a high-molecular weight (~440kDa) extracellular matrix glycoprotein that binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins called integrins.
In addition to integrins, fibronectin also binds extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibrin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (e.g. syndecans).
Fibronectin exists as a dimer, consisting of two nearly identical monomers linked by a pair of disulfide bonds.
The fibronectin protein is produced from a single gene, but alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA leads to the creation of several isoforms.
Two types of fibronectin are present in vertebrates: - soluble plasma fibronectin (formerly called "cold-insoluble globulin", or CIg) is a major protein component of blood plasma (300 Î¼g/ml) and is produced in the liver by hepatocytes.
- insoluble cellular fibronectin is a major component of the extracellular matrix.
It is secreted by various cells, primarily fibroblasts, as a soluble dimer and is then assembled into an insoluble matrix in a complex cell-mediated process.
Fibronectin plays a major role in cell adhesion, growth, migration and differentiation, and it is important for processes such as wound healing and embryonic development.
Altered fibronectin expression, degradation, and organization has been associated with a number of pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis.
Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013.
Most of these infections are believed to result from exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments, as H7N9 viruses have also been found in poultry in China.
While some mild illnesses in human H7N9 cases have been seen, most patients have had severe respiratory illness, with about one-third resulting in death.
Rare, limited person-to-person spread of this virus has been identified in China, but there is no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread of H7N9.
The first case outside of China was in Malaysia and was reported on February 12, 2014.
The case was detected in a traveler from an H7N9-affected area of China.
The new H7N9 virus has not been detected in people or birds in the United States as of this writing.

Hypochromic anemia is a generic term for any type of anemia in which the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are paler than normal.
(Hypo- refers to less, and chromic means color.)
A normal red blood cell will have an area of pallor in the center of it; in hypochromic cells, this area of central pallor is increased.
This decrease in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell.
The most common causes of this kind of anemia are iron deficiency and thalassemia.

Nitrogen balance is the measure of nitrogen input with the nitrogen output subtracted from it.
Nitrogen Balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen loss Blood urea nitrogen can be used in estimating nitrogen balance, as can the urea concentration in urine and feces.
A positive value is often found during periods of growth, tissue repair or pregnancy.
This means that the intake of nitrogen into the body is greater than the loss of nitrogen from the body, so there is an increase in the total body pool of protein.
A negative value can be associated with burns, fevers, wasting diseases and other serious injuries and during periods of fasting.
This means that the amount of nitrogen excreted from the body is greater than the amount of nitrogen ingested.
A negative Nitrogen balance can be used as part of a clinical evaluation of malnutrition.

Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine that typically remains in the blood between 48 and 96 hours.
The level of cotinine in the blood is proportionate to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including secondary smoke.
Women who smoke menthol cigarettes retain cotinine in the blood for a longer period.
Race may also play a role, as African-Americans routinely register higher blood cotinine levels than Caucasians.
Several factors, such as menthol cigarette preference and puff size, suggest that this difference may be more complex than gender or race.
Drug tests can detect cotinine in the blood, urine, or saliva.
The word 'cotinine' is an anagram of 'nicotine'.
Ferritin is a globular protein found mainly in the liver; when not combined with iron it is called apoferritin.

This panel represents the COOP Charts for adult/geriatric patients with a 1-10 numeric rating scale.
Images included with each term display the charts and indicate in color (red, green, yellow) the usual score "cutoffs" in clinical settings.
The Dartmouth-Northern New England Primary Care Cooperative Information Project (Dartmouth CO-OP Project) chart system has been developed to assess the functional status of adults and adolescents.
The dimensions of health status measured by the health charts are: Physical, Emotional, Daily Activities, Social Activities, Social Support, Pain, and Overall Health.
Two main versions of the COOP Charts exist: the original CO-OP charts (this panel) and the CO-OP/WONCA version.
The WONCA version has been developed as the international standard for classifying the functional status of adult patients in primary care settings.
This version differs from the original CO-OP Charts by asking about function in the previous 2 weeks (rather than 4 weeks).
Several variations of the COOP charts also exists and scoring across instruments varies (e.g. 1-10 where 10 is worst, 1-5 where 5 is worst, and some even reverse the numbers).
For scoring, typically the patient's answers, or scores, for each chart are recorded as-is in the patient's medical record; no scoring algorithm or computing is necessary.
A summative total score is not recommended by the developers, however some users may be recording it.

Glutathione (GSH) is an important low molecular weight thiol compound that is synthesized in cells.
Its primary functions are protecting cells against oxidative stress and regulating cell function.
Glutathione peroxidase oxidizes GSH to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) with concomitant formation of H20 from H2O2.
Most cells have a high GSH/GSSG ratio.
Cellular GSH concentration is typically a thousand-fold higher than the intravascular concentration.
Low intravascular levels of GSH are associated with chronic diseases including heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mitochondrial disorders, and low intracellular levels with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Higher than normal GSH levels have been found in a variety of cancerous cells, including bone marrow, breast, colon and lung, which makes the cells more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.

The FLT3 gene (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) is located on chromosome 13q12.
This gene encodes a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates hematopoiesis.
This receptor is activated by binding of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand to the extracellular domain, which induces homodimer formation in the plasma membrane leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor.
The activated receptor kinase subsequently phosphorylates and activates multiple cytoplasmic effector molecules in pathways involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow.
Mutations that result in the constitutive activation of this receptor result in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
FLT3 mutations occur in approximately 1/3 of patients with AML.
About 70% are internal tandem duplications, and the rest are due to variants in the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3, primarily at Asp835 (D835).

Pemoline has some advantages over other stimulants in that it does not reduce the appetite or cause dry mouth.
However, in some patients Pemoline is suspected of causing liver damage, so regular liver tests are performed on those treated with it.
Since receiving FDA approval in 1975, it has been linked with 21 cases of liver failure, of which 13 resulted in liver replacement or death.
In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for Pemoline due to pressure from certain public advocacy groups, including Public Citizen.
Patient support group the Narcolepsy Network tried to persuade the FDA not to ban it, on the grounds that some patients find all other treatments ineffective or to have dehabilitating side effects.

Iron homeostasis diseases are common and may be attributed to iron deficiency or iron overload.
Iron deficiency may be due to increased loss or inadequate absorption.
Iron overload occurs when the erythropoiesis is normal, but the iron exceeds the iron binding capacity of transferrin.
Iron overload may also occur when catabolism of red cells occurs.
Iron levels are used to help diagnose specific types of anemia.
Iron levels are low in iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease.
Iron levels are normal to increased in sideroblastic anemia and increased in hemolytic anemias,hemochromatosis, and acute liver disease.
Normal to decreased iron levels are seen with protein depletion.
Other tests used as iron status indicators include ferritin, transferrin, TIBC, and iron saturation.(Jacobs and DeMott Laboratory Test Handbook, 5th edition, DS Jacobs, WR DeMott and DK Oxley, 2001.)
In veterinary toxicology, one of the best known types of iron poisoning is in young piglets infected with an iron dextran preparation for the prevention of postnatal anemia.
However, iron intoxication can also occur in other animal species.
The F9 gene (coagulation factor IX) is located on chromosome Xq27.1-q27.2.
This gene encodes vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor IX that circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen.
This factor is converted to an active form by factor XIa, which excises the activation peptide and thus generates a heavy chain and a light chain held together by one or more disulfide bonds.
The role of this activated factor IX in the blood coagulation cascade is to activate factor X to its active form through interactions with Ca+2 ions, membrane phospholipids, and factor VIII.
Alterations of this gene, including point mutations, insertions and deletions, cause factor IX deficiency, which is a recessive X-linked disorder, also called hemophilia B or Christmas disease.

Phase analysis of the timing of myocardial contraction is used in nuclear cardiology to quantify regional ventricular wall motion and evaluate certain conditions, including bundle branch block, ventricular pacing, and pre-excitation syndromes.
Phase and amplitude together are used to classify wall motion, which is also a measure of cardiac dyssynchrony.
The phase value is defined as the amount of shift in the sine or cosine curve (measured in degrees) using the fundamental frequency of the Fourier fitting, and all of the individual phase values are used together to create a phase histogram in order to see the distribution pattern of phase values.
Separate histograms are created for the rest and stress portions of the study.
Multiple parameters are calculated from the histogram: 1. Phase maximum (degrees);
Phase mean (degrees); 3.
Phase standard deviation (degrees); 4. Phase bandwidth, which is defined as 95% of the histogram width (degrees); and 5.
Phase entropy, which is an index of disorder reported on a scale of 0-1 (0-100%), with 0 meaning complete order and 1 meaning complete disorder.
Zimelidine (Normud, Zelmid) was the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant to be marketed.
It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants.
Zimelidine has been banned worldwide due to serious, sometimes fatal, cases of central and/or peripheral neuropathy known as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and due to a peculiar hypersensitivity reaction involving many organs including skin exanthema, flu-like symptoms, arthralgias, and sometimes eosinophilia.
Additionally, zimelidine was charged to cause an increase in suicidal ideation and/or attempts among depressive patients.
After its ban, it was succeeded by fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (derived from the antihistamine diphenhydramine) in that order, and the other SSRIs.

It is commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol, and as calcium pantothenate.
Pantothenic acid is an ingredient in some hair and skin care products.
Colorado Tick Fever (CTF) also called (Mountain tick fever, Mountain fever, and American mountain fever) is an acute viral infection transmitted from the bite of an infected wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) a member of the Coltivirus genera.
CTF infects haemopoietic cells especially erythrocytes, which explains how the virus is trasmitted by bloodsicking ticks and also accounts for the incidence of transmission via blood transfusion.
The disease develops from March to September, with the highest infections occurring in May and June.
The disease is found almost exclusively in the western United States and Canada, mostly in high mountain areas such as Colorado and Idaho.
The CTF virus was first isolated from human blood in 1944.
The virus particle, like other Coltiviruses, is ~80 nm in diameter and is generally non-envolped.
The double stranded RNA viral genome is ~20,000bp long and is divided into 12 segments, which are termed Seg-1 to Seg-12.
Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, multilayered, icosahedral viruses composed of an outer layer, an inner layer, and a core.
After the immature, double-layered virus is assembled in the host cell cytoplasm, they bud across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acquire a temporary membrane that has on its surface the ER resident viral glycoproteins NSP4, VP4 and VP7.
The virus loses its temporary membrane and the NSP4 glycoprotein as it moves toward the center of the ER cisternae.
The VP4 and VP7 proteins are pushed to the outermost membrane layer and become the mature triple-layered rotavirus.
The outer capsid glycoprotein VP7 is believed to be important for the attachment to and entry in the host cell.
After it enters the host cell, the VP7 glycoprotein is lost.
When the host cell lyses, the mature virus are released.
There are groups of rotavirus, A through H. Groups A, B, C, and H are associated with an acute gastroenteritis and are found in humans and animals.

More specifically, alpha-ketobutyric acid is a product of the lysis of cystathionine.
It is also one of the degradation products of threonine.
It can be converted to propionyl-CoA (and subsequently methylmalonyl CoA, which can be converted to succinyl CoA, a citric acid cycle intermediate), and thus enter the citric acid cycle.
A repetitive insertion sequence, IS481, has been found to be present in up to 100 copies within the genome of B. pertussis.
In B. holmesii, 8-10 copies of this insertion sequence can be found.
On rare occasion, the B. bronchiseptica genome may contain a copy of this sequence.
Thus, all these species may test positive in assays targeting the IS481 sequence.
Concurrent culturing is used to differentiate species from B. pertussis and confirm the organism, while targeted DNA testing allows preliminary results to be reported the same day that the specimen is received.
A glucagon stimulation test (also called glucagon challenge test) is used to help diagnose the etiology of hypoglycemia.
A baseline glucose is measured, followed by glucagon administration and subsequent glucose measurement at specific intervals.
An increase in glucose concentration post glucagon is indicative of hyperinsulinism, while a lack of response to glucagon indicates that insufficient glycogen is available.
Glycogen insufficiency could be due to a variety of disorders, including those related to glycogen production, storage, or metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and cortisol or growth hormone deficiency.

It is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time (PT) which measures the extrinsic pathway.
Oats, from an erect, tufted annual grass growing to 1.2 m, are of uncertain origin, but probably arose in Europe from 2 species, Wild oats (A. fatua L.) and Wild red oats (A. sterilis L.).
Oats are now cultivated throughout the temperate zones of the world.
The major growing areas are the USA, southern Canada, the USSR and Europe, particularly near the Mediterranean.
Oats serve as food for humans, animal fodder and bedding, and - especially in the form of extracts - in a variety of industrial uses.
There are many named varieties, with new forms being developed each year.
Oats are available as whole Oat grains when only the husks are removed; Oatmeal from cut or ground Oats; and rolled Oats when grains are cut in slices and then steamed and rolled.

Influenza virus from the family Orthomyxoviridae are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes containing seven to eight gene segments.
Of the five genera in the family, only influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B and C viruses are medically relevant to humans.
Influenza A and B viruses have a similar structure whereby these viruses each contain eight discrete single-stranded RNA gene segments, each encoding at least one protein.
While having a close phylogenetic relationship, influenza virus types A and B manifest very differently.
While IAV infects birds, humans and other mammals, influenza B only infects humans and seals.
Although both viruses cause human respiratory infection seasonally in temperate climate regions and more continually in the tropics, influenza B is normally less prevalent and causes less severe disease than IAV viruses.
Research is ongoing to determine the evolutionary and epidemiological factors that shape the genetic diversity of influenza B virus.

The follicle-stimulating hormone beta (FSHB) gene encodes the follitropin subunit beta protein.
The beta subunit protein, along with an identical alpha subunit, makes up the follicle-stimulating hormone, which is involved in egg and sperm production.
A promoter polymorphism (c.-211G>T; rs10835638) in the FSHB gene was found to significantly reduce FSH serum levels and may be associated with reduced fertility in men (Grigorova et al.
Apolipoproteins are a family of proteins involved in cholesterol transport and metabolism.
Apoliprotein B is a primary protein component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad" cholesterol), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons and is encoded by the APOB gene.
The liver produces the B-100 form, which includes a region that is recognized by the ApoB/E LDL receptor, and the small intestine produces B-48, which is cleaved from B-100 and does not include the receptor region.
Deficiency of apolipoprotein B is associated with low LDL levels and fat malabsorption, while high levels of circulating apolipoprotein B-100, which can be a result of a defect in the ApoB/E receptor ligand, are associated with high cholesterol and risk for coronary artery disease .
A thioxanthine with effects similar to the phenothiazine antipsychotics.
Art v 3 is a Lipid transfer protein (LTP) form mugwort pollen displaying cross-reactivity to Rosaceae fruit LTPs, such as Pru p 3 from peach and Cor a 8 from hazelnut.
Parathyrin intact (iPTH) levels are requested for the differential diagnosis of calcium-related abnormalities.
The test is useful for diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia.
Because there are many fragments of PTH, tests for PTH may measure one or more of the fragments.
None of the assays for intact PTH measure PTH (35-84), which is actually the fragment of PTH present in highest amounts in blood.
Many intact PTH assays measure either PTH (1-84) or PTH (7-84).
In most people, PTH (7-84) is present in much lower amounts than PTH (1-84), so this is not a concern.
But in kidney failure, PTH (7-84) levels increase compared to PTH (1-84), and sometimes over half of what is measured as PTH represents this N-terminal truncated fragment.
Some intact PTH assays do not measure this fragment and will give lower PTH results when increased PTH (7-84) is present.
The CD44 protein is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration.
It is a receptor for hyaluronic acid and can also interact with other ligands, such as osteopontin, collagens, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
A specialized sialofucosylated glycoform of CD44 called HCELL is found natively on human hematopoietic stem cells, and is a highly potent E-selectin and L-selectin ligand.
HCELL functions as a "bone homing receptor", directing migration of human hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells to bone marrow.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation and proliferation of immune cells.
The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) has three subunits, and different combinations of these subunits have varying affinity for IL-2.
The soluble form of the IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) does not have cell membrane and cytoplasmic components but retains the ability to bind IL-2.
Elevated sIL-2R in serum and other body fluids may be a marker for the advanced stages of certain cancer as well as autoimmune diseases.
A patient's body fat percentage is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass.
A number of methods are available for determining body fat percentage, such as measurement with calipers, hydrostatic weighing, whole-body air displacement plethysmography, or bioelectrical impedance analysis.
The percentage of body fat in an individual varies according to sex and age.
The SCO2 gene (SCO2 cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein) is located on chromosome 22q13.33.
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, which helps to maintain the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is necessary for aerobic ATP production.
Human COX is a multimeric protein complex that requires several assembly factors; this gene encodes one of the COX assembly factors.
The encoded protein is a metallochaperone that is involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II.
Mutations in this gene are associated with fatal infantile encephalocardiomyopathy and myopia 6.
Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, multilayered, icosahedral viruses composed of an outer layer, an inner layer, and a core.
After the immature, double-layered virus is assembled in the host cell cytoplasm, they bud across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and acquire a temporary membrane that has on its surface the ER resident viral glycoproteins NSP4, VP4 and VP7.
The virus loses its temporary membrane and the NSP4 glycoprotein as it moves toward the center of the ER cisternae.
The VP4 and VP7 proteins are pushed to the outermost membrane layer and become the mature triple-layered rotavirus.
The outer capsid glycoprotein VP7 is believed to be important for the attachment to and entry in the host cell.
After it enters the host cell, the VP7 glycoprotein is lost.
When the host cell lyses, the mature virus are released.
There are eight groups of rotavirus, A through H. Groups A, B, C, and H are associated with an acute gastroenteritis and are found in humans and animals.
Groups D, E, F, and G are found only in animals.
Rotavirus A (RVA) are the cause an acute gastroenteritis in children and animals.
RVA is the most common infectious organism to cause severe gastroenteritis in children less than 3 years of age.
It is estimated that 95% of children worldwide between the ages of 3 and 5 will become infected with RVA.
Approximately 8000 children under 5 years of age in Latin America and the Caribbean die of acute enteritis caused by RVA.
Test does not measure the 7-84 fragment which is measured by the Intact PTH method.
Nonstructural protein 5B (NS5b) is a viral protein found in hepatitis C virus (HCV), and has the main function of replicating the HCV viral RNA by using the viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzing the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP).
The S282T mutation has been identified as the common variant that can confer resistance to sofosbuvir, however, this mutation is not generally present in untreated patients with HCV.

A second-generation cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly.
Its bactericidal action results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis.
It is used for urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and soft tissue and bone infections.
Hemoglobin E or haemoglobin E (HbE) is an abnormal hemoglobin with a single point mutation in the Î² chain.
At position 26 there is a change in the amino acid, from glutamic acid to lysine.
HbE is one of the most common variant of normal hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin E can be detected on electrophoresis.
This hemoglobin variant is very common in Southeast Asia and it has a low frequency in black and white people.
The Î²E mutation affects Î²-gene expression creating an alternate splicing site in the mRNA at codons 25-27 of the Î²-globin gene.
Through this mechanism, there is a mild deficiency in normal Î² mRNA and production of small amounts of anomalous Î² mRNA.
The reduced synthesis of Î² chain may cause Î² thalassemia.
Also, this hemoglobin variant has a weak union between Î± and Î² globin, causing instability when there is a high amount of oxidant.
Hemoglobin E disease results when the offspring inherits the gen for HbE from both parents.
At birth, babies homozygous for the hemoglobin E allele do not present symptoms due to HbF (fetal hemoglobin) they still have.
In the first months of life, fetal hemoglobin disappears and the amount of hemoglobin E increases, so the subjects start to have a mild Î² thalassemia.
People with hemoglobin E do not show any symptoms (there is usually no anemia or hemolysis).
Subjects homozygous for the hemoglobin E allele have a mild hemolytic anemia and mild splenomegaly.
Once LDL accumulates in the subendothelial space, it tends to become modified or oxidized.
This oxidized LDL plays several key roles in furthering the course of the inflammatory process.
It is chemotactic to monocytes; oxidized LDL causes endothelial cells to secrete molecules that cause monocytes to penetrate between the endothelial cells and accumulate in the intima.
Oxidized LDL promotes death of endothelial cells by augmenting apoptosis.
Also, through the activation of collagenases, ox-LDL contributes to a process which may lead to the rupture of the fibrous plaque.
Oxidized LDL decreases the availability of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which, in turn, increases the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium.
Moreover, NO is involved in paracrine signalling between the endothelium and the smooth muscle that maintains vascular tone; without it, the muscle will not relax, and the blood vessel remains constricted.
Thus, oxidized LDL also contributes to the hypertension often seen with atherosclerosis.
A non-essential amino acid occurring in nature in the L-isomer form.
It is synthesized from glycine or threonine and is involved in the biosynthesis of putines, pyrimidines, and other amino acids.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is characterized by its precipitation by the C-fraction of pneumococci.

Prostaglandin E1 acts as a vasodilator and bronchodilator and inhibits gastric secretion.
It also inhibits platelet aggregation.
Cytidine is a nucleoside that is composed of the base cytosine linked to the five-carbon sugar D-ribose.
Cytidine is a pyrimidine that besides being incorporated into nucleic acids, can serve as substrate for the salvage pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis; as precursor of the cytidine triphosphate (CTP) needed in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthetic pathway.
These variations probably reflect the species differences in cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that converts cytidine to uridine in the body.
The transports of cytidine into the brain's extracellular fluid, and then into neurons and glia, are essential prerequisites for cytidine to be utilized in brain.
An efficient mechanism mediating the brain uptake of circulating cytidine has not yet been demonstrated.
The biosynthesis of PC, the most abundant phosphatide in the brain, via the Kennedy pathway requires phosphocholine and cytidine triphosphate (CTP), a cytidine nucleotide, which is involved in the rate-limiting step.
The enzyme that converts CTP to endogenous CDP-choline (CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase) is unsaturated at physiological brain CTP levels.
APOBEC is a family of enzymes has been discovered with the ability to deaminate cytidines on RNA or DNA.
The human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, or hA3G) protein, provides cells with an intracellular antiretroviral activity that is associated with the hypermutation of viral DNA through cytidine deamination.
Indeed, hA3G belongs to a family of vertebrate proteins that contain one or two copies of a signature sequence motif unique to cytidine deaminases (CTDAs).
In biochemistry, cholinesterase is a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation.
There are two types:
1. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), also known as RBC cholinesterase, erythrocyte cholinesterase, or (most formally) acetylcholine acetylhydrolase, found primarily in the blood and neural synapses.
Acetylcholinesterase exists in multiple molecular forms.
In the mammalian brain the majority of AChE occurs as a tetrameric, G4 form (10) with much smaller amounts of a monomeric G1 (4S) form.
2. Pseudocholinesterase (BChE or BuChE), also known as plasma cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, or (most formally) acylcholine acylhydrolase, found primarily in the liver.
The difference between the two types of cholinesterase has to do with their respective preferences for substrates: the former hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly; the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine more quickly.
The half-life of pseudocholinesterase is approximately 8-16 hours.
Pseudocholinesterase levels may be reduced in patients with advanced liver disease.
The decrease must be greater than 75% before significant prolongation of neuromuscular blockade occurs with succinylcholine.
An absence or mutation of the pseudocholinesterase enzyme leads to a medical condition known as pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
This is a silent condition that manifests itself only when people that have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during a surgery.
Pseudocholinesterase deficiency may also affect local anaesthetic selection in dental procedures.
The enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of ester-based local anaesthetics, a deficiency lowers the margin of safety and increases the risk of systemic effects with this type of anaesthetic.
The selection of an amide-based solution is recommended in such patients.
Elevation of plasma pseudocholinesterase was observed in 90.5% cases of acute myocardial infarction.
The presence of acetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid may be tested in early pregnancy.
A sample of amniotic fluid is removed by amniocentesis, and presence of AChE can confirm several common types of birth defect, including abdominal wall defects and neural tube defects.
Butyrylcholinesterase can be used as a prophylactic agent against nerve gas and other organophosphate poisoning
Folic acid is a B vitamin (Vitamin B9) and helps the body make healthy new cells.
Everyone needs folic acid, especially women who may get pregnant.
Getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy can prevent major birth defects of the baby's brain or spine.
Foods with folic acid in them include leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas, nuts and enriched breads, cereals and other grain products.
The fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg) is a measure of the percentage of magnesium excreted in the urine versus the magnesium reabsorbed by the kidney.
For hypomagnesemic patients with normal renal function, FEMg is a useful tool for determining the etiology of hypomagnesemia.
A value of more than four per cent is indicative of inappropriate renal magnesium loss.
Histidine ammonia-lyase (or histidase) is an enzyme that converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid.
Mutations in the gene for histidase are associated with histidinemia and urocanic aciduria.
Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.
Most of the lipids are phospholipids including lecithin (L), sphingomyelin (S), disaturated lecithin, phosphatidyl inositol (PI), and phosphatidyl glycerol (PG).
All of these phospholipids are manufactured by the fetal lung, possess surface tension activity, and are secreted into the amniotic fluid.
Lecithin is present in the lung in the highest concentration, but must be stabilized by PI and/or PG to have maximal surface tension reducing activity.
The relative concentrations of these phospholipids determine the degree of fetal lung maturity.
The fetal risk of RDS can be estimated by measuring the amniotic fluid phospholipid concentrations.
This uroflowmetry panel contains noninvasive diagnostic tests that evaluate the function of the urinary tract (bladder and sphincter) by measuring the volume of urine released from the body, the speed of the release, and how long the release takes.

Oyster has been reported as both an ingested and occupational allergen.
Oysters are eaten fresh and canned, but also smoked.
The Japanese have extensive off-bottom culture, especially in protected bays.
The Chinese have all over the world exported a pungent sauce made from oyster extract and used for flavoring.
The AKT1 gene (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) is located on chromosome 14q32.32.
The serine-threonine protein kinase encoded by the AKT1 gene is catalytically inactive in serum-starved primary and immortalized fibroblasts.
AKT1 and the related AKT2 are activated by platelet-derived growth factor.
The activation is rapid and specific, and it is abrogated by mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1.
It was shown that the activation occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
In the developing nervous system AKT is a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival.
Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/threonine kinase AKT1, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with the Proteus syndrome.

Purkinje cells (or Purkinje neurons) are a class of GABAergic neuron located in the cerebellar cortex.
These cells are some of the largest neurons in the human brain, with an intricately elaborate dendritic arbor, characterized by a large number of dendritic spines.
Purkinje cells are found within the Purkinje layer in the cerebellum.
Purkinje cells are aligned like dominos stacked one in front of the other.
Their large dendritic arbors form nearly two dimensional layers through which parallel fibers from the deeper-layer granule cells pass.
These parallel fibers make relatively weaker excitatory (glutamatergic) synapses to spines in the Purkinje cell dendrite, whereas climbing fibers originating from the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla provide very powerful excitatory input to the proximal dendrites and cell soma.
In humans, Purkinje cells are affected in a variety of diseases ranging from toxic exposure (alcohol, lithium), to autoimmune diseases and to genetic mutations (spinocerebellar ataxias, Unverricht-Lundborg disease, autism) and neurodegenerative diseases that are not thought to have a known genetic basis (cerebellar type of multiple system atrophy, sporadic ataxias).
CD9 molecule, also known as CD9, is a human gene.

At least one family with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-22 (COXPD22) was found to have a homozygous missense mutation in the ATP5A1 gene.
Mutations in the ATP5A1 gene can also cause mitochondrial complex V deficiency nuclear type 4 (MC5DN4), which display similar clinical features as COXPD22.
Middle (mid) light scatter (fluorescence) reticulocytes are measured to find the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF).
IRF is calculated by first dividing the reticulocytes into three categories (low-LFR, medium- MFR, and high fluorescence reticulocytes-HFR), depending on the amount of scatter they produced.
The most immature reticulocytes (HFR) produce higher scatter, with the more mature reticulocytes producing the medium and low scatter.
The IRF is the sum of reticulocyte fractions with medium and high fluorescence.
A rise in IRF is one of the earliest indicators of bone marrow engraftment or recovery from intensive chemotherapy.
The IRF can also be used as an early indicator of response to erythropoietin therapy in patients with chronic renal failure and other diseases.

Prompt diagnosis and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) are critical for reducing mortality and disability.
A key predictor of clinical response to replacement therapy is a patient's CRIM (cross-reactive immunological material to GAA) status, which is based on the presence or absence of endogenous GAA.
Patients who are CRIM-positive produce detectable GAA and are typically immunologically tolerant of rhGAA, whereas approximately 20% of patients who are CRIM-negative develop high levels of antibodies against exogenous rhGAA, which eventually reduces the efficacy of therapy .
Leprosy, described as early as the 5th century BC, is an ancient, though still active, chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.
The exact method of transmission has yet to be discovered, but nasal droplet infection is suspected.
Leprosy predominantly involves the skin and peripheral nervous system.
Forms of leprosy are varied, are largely dependent upon the host individual's immunity or susceptibility to M. leprae, and generally fall into three categories.
Lepromatous leprosy is most common in those with impaired T-cell immunity, and tuberculoid leprosy in individuals with healthy immunity.
Borderline (intermediate) leprosy accounts for the majority of cases and encompassess characteristics of both tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.
Diagnosis is made through clinical signs and microscopic evaluation of lymph fluid from skin lesions and nasal mucosa.
PCR, serological and histopathological studies may also be employed depending on the suspected leprosy form.

Borrelia mayonii is the proposed name for a bacterial species found in 2013, causing Lyme disease in six people who live in the upper Midwestern United States.
Worldwide, Lyme disease is caused by three main species of bacteria: Borrelia burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii.
Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in the United States, while the other two species are the leading causes of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia.
B. mayonii is a new species that is genetically distinct from these three species and is the only species besides B. burgdorferi shown to cause Lyme disease in North America.
B. mayonii has been identified in blacklegged (or "deer") ticks collected in several counties in northwestern Wisconsin and Minnesota.
It is highly likely, however, that infected ticks occur in other areas of both states.
Limited information suggests that illness caused by B. mayonii is similar to that caused by B. burgdorferi, but with a few possible differences.
Like B. burgdorferi, B. mayonii causes fever, headache, rash, and neck pain in the early stages of infection (days after exposure) and arthritis in later stages of infection (weeks after exposure).
Unlike B. burgdorferi however, B. mayonii appears to be associated with nausea and vomiting, diffuse rashes, and a higher concentration of bacteria in the blood.
Patients infected with B. mayonii have been successfully treated with a 2-4 week course of doxycycline.
Amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime have also been used.
2-Heptanone, or methyl n-amyl ketone, is a ketone with the molecular formula C7H14O.

The 7q11.23 chromosome region is known as the critical region for Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a contiguous gene deletion syndrome cause by a 1.5 to 1.8 Mb hemizygous deletion in this chromosome region containing approximately 28 genes.
WBS is a multisystem disorder with highly variable medical problems, variable developmental delay, and characteristic facial features.
Young children have a pixie like-face, with a flat nasal bridge, short upturned nose, periorbital puffiness, and long philtrum, whereas older patients have slightly coarse features, with full lips, a wide smile, and a full nasal tip.
Another condition known as the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is caused by a duplication of genes within the 7q11.23 chromosome region.
It is also a multisystem developmental disorder with variable manifestations, most commonly speech delay and mild craniofacial anomalies.

The MRPS18A gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18A) is located on chromosome 6p21.3.
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion.
Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit.
They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed.
Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA.
Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.
This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S18P family.
The encoded protein is one of three that has significant sequence similarity to bacterial S18 proteins.
The primary sequences of the three human mitochondrial S18 proteins are no more closely related to each other than they are to the prokaryotic S18 proteins.
A pseudogene corresponding to this gene is found on chromosome 3p.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Uric acid (urate) is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides.
In humans, about 70% of daily uric acid disposal occurs via the kidneys.
Elevated levels of uric acid, or hyperuricemia, may be due to genetic inheritance or diet.
Excess serum levels of uric acid can lead to a type of arthritis known as gout, kidney stones, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS), an extremely rare inherited disorder, is also associated with very high serum uric acid levels.
Spasticity, involuntary movement and cognitive retardation as well as manifestations of gout are seen in cases of this syndrome.
LNS is due to mutations in the HPRT1 gene.
To date (2012), mutations in nine other genes have been linked to the excretion of uric acid by the kidneys: SLC2A9; ABCG2; SLC17A1; SLC22A11; SLC22A12; SLC16A9; GCKR; LRRC16A; and PDZK1.

The Bet v 6 antigen has been shown to be 56-80% similar to IFRs present on other plants and may be the cause of pollen-related oral allergy to some foods and in small numbers of patients sensitized to birch pollen.
Thirty-two percent of patients with birch pollen sensitivity have been shown to react to Bet v 6 while 89% reacted to Bet v 1.
Bet v 6 is considered a minor allergen.
Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Patients with AD have deficiencies in the production of acetylcholine, which is essential to attention and consciousness.
These deficiencies are due to neuronal death, decreased choline acetyl transferase synthesis (the primary enzyme needed to produce acetylcholine), and neuroimmunological responses.
The use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drugs reduces the breakdown of acetylcholine in patients with AD and markedly improves their cognitive abilities.
However, they are not known to cure AD or prevent the loss of cognitive abilities in the future.

Segmented neutrophils are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear neutrophils, PMNs, or "polys".
Therefore, in common usage the term polymorphonuclear leukocyte (or polymorphonuclear WBC) refers to neutrophils.
When PMNs appear in a complete blood count report, it certainly means segmented neutrophils.
However you should apply some caution to interpretation of the meaning of polymorphonuclear, because it is possible to consider all granulocytes, including neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils, as "polymorphonuclear cells" due to the variable shape of their nuclei.
Basophils can therefore be referred to polymorphonuclear basophil (PMB), eosinophils as polymorphonuclear eosinophils (PME), in addition to neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophil, PMN).
CD23, also known as Fc epsilon RII, or FcÎµRII, is the "low affinity" receptor for IgE, an antibody isotype involved in allergy and resistance to parasites and is important in regulation of IgE levels.
Unlike many of the antibody receptors, CD23 is a C-type lectin.
It is found on mature B cells, activated macrophages, eosinophils, follicular dendritic cells and platelets.
There are two forms of CD23: CD23a and CD23b.
CD23a is unconditionally present on B cells, while CD23b requires IL-4 to be expressed on T-cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells, eosinophils and macrophages.
The allergen responsible in dust mite allergy, Der-p-1, is known to cleave CD23 from a cells surface.
As CD23 is soluble it can move freely and interact with cells in plasma.
Recent studies have shown that increased levels of soluble CD23 cause the recruitment of non-sensitised B-cells in the presentation of antigen peptides to allergen specific B-cells, therefore increasing the production of allergen specific IgE. IgE in turn is known to upregulate the cellular expression of CD23 and Fc epsilon RI (high affinity IgE receptor).
The simplest hydrocarbon, methane, is a gas (at standard temperature and pressure, STP) with a chemical formula of C H 4.
Pure methane is odorless, but when used commercially is usually mixed with small quantities of odorants, strongly-smelling sulfur compounds such as ethanethiol (also called ethyl mercaptan), to enable the detection of leaks.
The principal component of natural gas, methane is a significant and plentiful fuel.
Burning one molecule of methane in the presence of oxygen releases one molecule of CO2 (carbon dioxide) and two molecules of H2 O (water): CH4 + 2O2 â ' CO2 + 2H2
OMethane's relative abundance and clean burning process makes it a very attractive fuel.
However, because it is a gas and not a liquid or solid, methane is difficult to transport from the areas that produce it to the areas that consume it.
Converting methane to forms that are more easily transported, such as LNG (liquefied natural gas) and methanol, is an active area of research.

Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic amplification of the target nucleic acid strands.
The GEN-PROBE APTIMA Combo 2 Assay replicates a specific region of the 23S rRNA from CT and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from GC via DNA intermediates.
A unique set of primers is used for each target molecule.
Detection of the rRNA amplification product sequences (amplicon) is achieved using nucleic acid hybridization.
Single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probes, which are complementary to a region of each target amplicon, are labeled with different acridinium ester molecules.
The labeled DNA probes combine with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids.
The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from unhybridized probe.
During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).
In DKA, differences in the kinetic profiles of the CT and GC labeled probes allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements of photon output during the detection read time.
The chemiluminescent detection reaction for CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the "flasher" kinetic type.
The chemiluminescent detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the "glower" kinetic type.
Assay results are determined by a cut-off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.

Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is commonly used for taxonomic classification and identification of bacteria.
The 16S gene is approximately 1500bp long and is universal in bacteria, allowing its relationships to be measured among all bacteria.
Because it is universal among all bacteria, detection of 16S RNA can also be used to estimate bacterial load.
The 16S sequence has a role in identifying bacteria that are atypical or rare that are unable to be identified by phenotypic tests alone.
In general there is not enough variation in 16S sequence for its use in distinguishing strains for epidemiological purposes.
Fluorquinolones are among most beneficial drugs used to treat multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections.
The fluorquinolones affect the activity of DNA gyrase by reducing the cell's ability for DNA replication and transcription.
DNA gyrase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is made of two subunits that are encoded by gyrA and gyrB. Mutations in the gyrA quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) are responsible for causing most of the drug resistance of TB to the fluoroquinolones.
The gyrB mutations have a much smaller impact on TB resistance to the fluoroquinolones.
Monensin is a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces cinnamonensis.
It is usually administered as the sodium salt and incorporated in the animal's food to improve feed efficiency and for the prevention and control of coccidiosis.
Because of the common use of monensin in the feed industry, swine and other animals may be accidently exposed to monensin and sometimes to toxic concentrations.
Diagnosis of monensin toxicosis is established by observation of typical clinical signs and pathologic changes along with documentation of toxic concentrations of monensin in the feed by chemical analysis.

Plasmodium knowlesi is a primate malaria parasite commonly found in Southeast Asia.
It causes malaria in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), but it may also infect humans, either naturally or artificially.
Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth major human malaria parasite.
It may cause severe malaria as indicated by its asexual erythrocytic cycle of about 24 hours, with an associated fever that typically occurs at the same frequency (i.e. the fever is quotidian).
This is an emerging infection that was reported for the first time in humans in 1965.
It accounts for up to 70% of malaria cases in certain areas in South East Asia where it is mostly found.
This parasite is transmitted by the bite of an Anopheles mosquito.
Plasmodium knowlesi has health, social and economic consequences for the regions affected by it.
Although the current infection rate with Plasmodium knowlesi is relatively low, one risk it presents is misdiagnosis with other forms of malarial parasites such as P. malariae especially when microscopy is used.
P. knowlesi can only be accurately distinguished from P. malariae using PCR assay and/or molecular characterization.
Because P. knowlesi takes only 24 hours to complete its erythrocytic cycle, it can result in very high parasite density quickly and may be fatal in humans.
For this reason early treatment is advised.
It responds well to treatment with chloroquine and primaquine.
but if parasite counts are high and patients are severe, then infections should be treated as intensively as for severe falcipaum malaria.
Anaerococcus prevotii and vaginalis are two species in the genus Anaerococcus, and were previously classified under the genus Peptostreptococcus.

Some affected infants will exhibit vomiting, hypoglycemia, lethargy, poor feeding, failure to thrive, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, and microcephaly.
Some individuals begin to experience signs and symptoms during adulthood, while others remain asymptomatic.
Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is caused by mutations in the ACADS gene and has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
Anacardium occidentale (Ana o) 3 is a 2S albumin and a major allergen of cashew nuts that elicits an allergic response in 81% of people with a sensitivity to cashews.
2S albumins have a very stable intrinsic structure that is preserved even in harsh environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract where it is believed to initiate an immune response.
Due to its resistance to both hydrolysis in the intestinal tract and denaturation by heat, Ana o 3 is considered a very potent allergen.
Three native large subunit isoforms of recombinant Ana o 3 have been identified to have 16 reactive peptides, four of which produce strong signals.
One isoform shares a fair amount of homology with a walnut isoform and offers a basis for cross-reactivity of walnut with the Ana o 3 isotope.

The ERBB2 gene (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2) is located on chromosome 17q12.
This gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases.
This protein has no ligand binding domain of its own and therefore cannot bind growth factors.
However, it does bind tightly to other ligand-bound EGF receptor family members to form a heterodimer, stabilizing ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase.
Allelic variations at amino acid positions 654 and 655 of isoform a (positions 624 and 625 of isoform b) have been reported, with the most common allele, Ile654/Ile655, shown here.

The biological value of a protein refers to how well and how quickly the body can actually use the protein.
Generally, animal proteins have high biological value, that is, they contain complete essential amino acids necessary for life.
Plant proteins can also be high biological value depending on the food and the clinical situation.
For example, patients with kidney disease have to monitor their phosphorous intake, so a protein such as whey that contains a low level of phosphorus would be considered of high biological value.
For vegetarians, non-meat animal proteins (milk, yogurt, eggs) and high- value plant proteins should be combined with complementary foods (rice and beans for example) to provide all of the essential amino acids.
For patients with inborn errors of metabolism, high biological value proteins are foods that do not contain, or contain very little of, the amino acid that they cannot metabolize.

Children with atopic dermatitis may have an immediate exacerbation of symptoms, or a delayed reaction causing a worsening of their dermatitis 1-2 days after exposure to egg.
Delayed reactions are possible and are generally not IgE-mediated, and are probably caused by T-cell sensitisation.
Eosinophilic esophagitis as a result of allergy to egg has been described.
IgE-mediated sensitivity to egg proteins in egg-processing workers has been reported.
Poikilocytosis are abnormally shaped red blood cells (RBC) sometimes seen on blood smears of humans and many wild and domestic animals.
They are more common in some apparently normal small ruminants, particularly goats.
Normal RBC are round, flattened disks that are thinner in the middle than at the edges, whereas a poikilocyte is either a distortion of that normal shape or an entirely different shape.
Generally, poikilocytosis refers to an increase in abnormal RBC of any shape where they make up 10% or more of the total red cell population.
Poikilocytosis is a rather general condition rather than a specific one.

The GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FXN gene causes Friedreich ataxia, a neuromuscular condition with symptoms of ataxia, impaired speech, spasticity, and gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs.
Most individuals with Friedreich ataxia have the expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in both copies of the FXN gene.
The GAA segment is repeated 66 to more than 1,000 times.
About 2 percent of people with this condition have an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat in one copy of the FXN gene and another kind of mutation in the other copy of the gene.
Mutations in the FXN gene disrupt production of frataxin, greatly reducing the amount of this protein in cells.
Potassium (symbol K from Latin:kalium) is a key chemical element involved in neuron function and influencing osmotic balance between cells and interstitial fluid.
Depletion in potassium levels results in deficient fluid and electrolyte balance in the body as well as various nervous and cardiac dysfunctions.
Studies suggest diets high in potassium can reduce the risk of hypertension and possibly stroke.
Foods rich in potassium include parsley, dried apricots, potatoes, bananas, avocados, soybeans, and bran, as well as most fruits, vegetables, meat and fish.
Overall, clear cases of potassium deficiency are rare in healthy individuals.

Naturally acquired aviadenovirus diseases include enteritis, splenitis, inclusion body hepatitis, bronchitis, pulmonary congestion ventriculitis, pancreatitis, and oedema, depending on the species of bird infected.
Acid phosphatase is a phosphatase used to free attached phosphate groups from other molecules during digestion.
It is stored in lysosomes and functions when these fuse with endosomes, which are acidified while they function; therefore, it has an acid pH optimum.
Different forms of acid phosphatase are found in different organs, and their serum levels are used as a diagnostic for disease in the corresponding organs.
For example, elevated prostatic acid phosphatase levels may indicate the presence of prostate cancer.
Flaviviruses assemble as fusion-incompetent immature particles and then undergo conformational change leading to release of infectious virions.
Flavivirus infections also produce combined 'mosaic' particles which can be measured.
U-47700 is an novel synthetic opioid that is a selective Î¼ receptor-agonist with a potency 7.5 times greater than morphine.
It is structural isomer of AH-7921, another synthetic opioid with similar characteristics.
U-47700 was originally studied in the 1970s by the Upjohn Company as a potential analgesic but was never brought to market and has become an emerging drug of abuse.
It is known on the street as "pink" due to its pinkish hue when in pure form, although it is found cut into preparations of heroin (a combination known as "gray death") or fentanyl.
Common effects are analgesia, sedation, euphoria, itching, and miosis.
Because of its receptor affinity (Î¼-agonist), it has a high risk of addiction and respiratory depression .
Brucella suis is the causative agent of swine brucellosis, a zoonosis affecting pigs.
The disease typically causes chronic inflammatory lesions in the reproductive organs of susceptible animals or orchitis and may even affect joints and other organs.
The most common symptom is abortion in pregnant susceptible hosts at any stage of gestation.
Other manifestations are temporary or permanent sterility, lameness, posterior paralysis, spondylitis, and abscess formation.
It is transmitted mainly by ingestion of infected tissues or fluids, semen during breeding, and suckling infected animals.
In humans, it can cause undulant fever.
Since brucellosis threatens food supply and cause undulant fever, Brucella suis and other Brucella species (B. melitensis, B. abortis, B. ovis, B. canis) are recognized as potential agricultural, civilian, and military bioterrorism agents.
B. suis are gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacilli and therefore are capable of growing and reproducing inside of host cells, specifically phagocytic cells.
They are also non-spore-forming, non-capsulated, and non-motile.
Brucella suis are differentiated into five biovars (strains), where bv. 1-3 infect boars and pigs and bv.1 and 3 may cause severe diseases in humans.
In contrast, bv. 2 found in wild boars in Europe show mild or no clinical signs and cannot infect healthy humans, but do infect pigs and hares.

Glutaric acid (glutarate) is a simple five-carbon linear dicarboxylic acid.
The accumulation of glutaric acid ranging from slightly or intermittently elevated urinary glutaric acid to gross organic aciduria occurs in Glutaric aciduria.
Glutaric aciduria type 1 is an autosomal-recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, GCDH) which is involved in the metabolism of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan.
Glutaric aciduria type I lead to nonspecific developmental delay, hypotonia, and macrocephaly with cerebral atrophy of prenatal onset.
Treatment is mainly based on restriction of lysine intake, supplementation of carnitine, and an intensification of therapy during intercurrent illnesses.
The major principle of dietary treatment is to reduce the production of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid by restriction of natural protein in general and of lysine in particular. ,
The repetitive insertion sequence targets pIS1001 and hIS1001 are present in multiple copies per genome of Bordetella parapertussis and B. holmesii, respectively.
The "p" in pIS1001 is for parapertussis and "h" in hIS1001 is for holmesii.
These targets along with other target sequences (e.g. IS481) are used to detect and differentiate between B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. holmesii and other Bordetella species.

2S albumins have a very stable intrinsic structure that is preserved even in harsh environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract where it is believed to initiate an immune response.
The Cor a 14 protein affects 70% of children and 39% of adults sensitive to hazelnut proteins and is associated with severe allergic reactions in both demographic groups.
Cor a 14 sensitivity is predicitive of a severe allergic reaction when exposure to Cor a 14 occurs.
Nateglinide (INN, trade name Starlix) is a drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
ateglinide belongs to the meglitinide class of blood glucose-lowering drugs.
Nateglinide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas.
It achieves this by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the Î² cells.
This depolarizes the Î² cells and causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open.
The resulting calcium influx induces fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane, and insulin secretion occurs.

Other Kell antigens include Ku, Ula, Wka, Kx, Km, and Kp^c.
Antibodies to Kell antigens are important in transfusion medicine, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and hemolytic disease of the newborn, and the Kell system is the third most common cause of these diseases (after ABO and Rh).
CO2 content is a measurement of total CO2 in the blood.
Most of it is in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3) controlled by the kidney.
A small amount (5%) of CO2 is dissolved in the blood as insoluble carbonic acid (H2CO3).
Changes in CO2 content generally relate to metabolic issues, renal function and unusual losses (diarrhea).
Respiratory disease can ultimately effect CO2 content, but only slightly and only if prolonged.

PRRSV is spread among all ages of pigs and herds through direct and indirect contact.
PRRSV is considered one of the most economically important infectious agents in the swine industry worldwide.
The continual changing genomic characteristics of the various strains of this virus make testing of herds an important part of disease management.
The SI gene is located on chromosome 3q26.1 and encodes sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme located in the small intestine brush-border membrane that catalyzes the hydrolysis of dietary sucrose and some of the products of starch digestion.
Mutations in the SI gene are responsible for congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), a disorder characterized by secretory osmotic diarrhea and failure to thrive due to the malabsorption of sucrose and maltose.
Different SI gene mutations result in different phenotypes depending on whether the mutation disrupts enzyme transport or function.
Infants can present with severe diarrhea and failure to thrive, toddlers and children may have chronic diarrhea without failure to thrive, and adults may present with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
CSID is primarily treated with dietary restriction, and adjuvant enzyme replacement therapy has also been shown to be effective.
CSID follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and the prevalence is approximately 1 in 5,000 people of European descent and as high as 1 in 20 people in the native populations of Greenland, Alaska, and Canada.
Veterinary medicine: Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus that belongs in the family Picornaviridae.
Of the three species described for the genus Kobuvirus, the Aichivirus C (AiV-C) is the only species that infects swine.
The virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and the extensiveness of infection in domestic pigs ranges from 13-99%.
Wild boars are a suspected reservoir of infection of domestic swine.
PKoV/AiV-C has been isolated in swineherds in many countries across the world, including China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic, US, Netherlands, Kenya, Uganda, and Brazil.
In China, a herd of piglets infected with PKoV/AiV-C experienced symptoms including diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting.
PKoV/AiV-C is believed to require other pathogens in order to cause diarrhea in infected pigs, including transmissible gastroenteritis and rotavirus.
While PKoV/AiV-C has never been cultured, there are a number of laboratory methods that are able to detect its RNA or antigens, including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), electron microscopy, and serum neutralization.
There are no vaccines available for PKoV/AiV-C or in development.

CD38 (cluster of differentiation 38) is a glycoprotein found on the surface of many immune cells (white blood cells), including CD4+, CD8+, B and natural killer cells.
It is a marker of cell activation.
The CD38 protein has been connected to HIV infection, leukemias, myelomas, solid tumors, type II diabetes mellitus and bone metabolism, as well as some genetically determined conditions.
It has also been used as a prognostic marker in leukemia.
The gene encoding for CD38 is located on chromosome 4.
CD38 is a novel multifunctional ectoenzyme widely expressed in cells and tissues especially in leukocytes.
CD38 also functions in cell adhesion, signal transduction and calcium signaling.
CD34 is found on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as well as many of the more differentiated cells that CD38 is found on, so one method for isolating HSC cells is by selecting for cells that express CD34 but do not express CD38.

Typically, molecular testing methods, like reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), are used to detect hMPV.
hMPV is thought to be responsible for about 5% to 10% of pediatric hospitalizations of those suffering from acute respiratory tract infection.
The "Activation Ratio" is one of the tests ordered after more conventional Fragile X testing is positive.
The test is relevant only in females, where each cell has 2 copies of the X chromosome, only one of which is active.
It is generally performed on full mutant females.
The value is historically reported as a fraction between 0 and 1, and it represents the *proportion* of all the normal FMR1 gene copies that are located on the ACTIVE X chromosome.
Another way of saying this is that it is the proportion of all cells where the normal copy of the FMR1 gene is located on the active X chromosome.
The value is determined by the following formula from band intensities on a Southern blot: (normal unmethylated band intensity) / (sum of band intensities of the normal unmethylated + normal methylated bands)...that is, 2.8kband/(2.8k + 5.0k band).
The clinical relevance is that the higher the activation ratio, the more FMR1 protein is produced, so higher activation ratio is associated with better cognition.
Although the test is called a "Ratio", the LOINC property is "NFr" because the value represents the fraction of cells where the normal FMR1 is active.

The MRPS2 gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S2) is located on chromosome 9q34.
Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion.
Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit.
They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed.
Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA.
Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology.
This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S2 family.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.
Psilocybin (also known as psilocybine), is a psychedelic alkaloid of the tryptamine family.

Strain is defined as the deformation of a solid object in response to an applied force.
Cardiac strain has multiple components, such as circumferential, longitudinal, and radial, and strain can be either perpendicular or parallel (shear) to the force that is applied.
Principal strain is the direction of greatest deformation.
Strain is calculated as the change in length over a particular time period relative to the original length and is expressed as a percent.
Circumferential and longitudinal strain are typically negative, meaning shortening, while radial strain is normally a positive value, indicating lengthening.
The strain rate is the change in strain over time and has the unit of measure s^-1.

Chlamydophila psittaci is a lethal intracellular bacterial species that causes endemic avian chlamydiosis, epizootic outbreaks in mammals, and respiratory psittacosis in humans.
Chlamydophila psittaci is transmitted by inhalation, contact or ingestion among birds and to mammals.
Psittacosis in birds and in humans often starts with flu-like symptoms and becomes a life-threatening pneumonia.
Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated under stress.
Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydial infection because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.
Chlamydophila psittaci was previously classified as Chlamydia psittaci.

Somatotropin binding protein, also known as growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), binds to growth hormone (GH) and functions to increase the half-life of GH by restricting its distribution and preventing its decay.
GHBP levels are low in the developing fetus, but increase in the several years after birth to adult levels.
There are two forms of GHBP described as low-affinity GHBP and high-affinity GHBP.
Both forms bind to growth hormone; 5% of circulating GH is bound to low-affinity GHBP and 45% is bound to high-affinity GHBP.
There are several congenital and acquired conditions with altered GHBP levels including Laron-type dwarfism, pygmy dwarfism, malnutrition, obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and renal insufficiency.
The most clinically relevant use of GHBP measurements is to confirm suspected Laron dwarfism (where GHBP is absent) or carrier status (GHBP is low).

Carbapenems are stable to AmpC Î²-lactamases and extended-spectrum-Î²-lactamases.
Carbapenemases are a diverse group of b-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems.
Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-Î²-lactamases but many IMP and VIM producers are resistant, owing to other mechanisms.
Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C carbapenemase has been described.
IMP-type carbapenemases (one of the metallo-Î²-lactamases)(class B): Plasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases, 17 varieties of which are currently known, found in enteric Gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species.
VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-Î²-lactamase): A second growing family of carbapenemases, the VIM family, VIM enzymes occur mostly in P. aeruginosa, also P. putidaand, very rarely, Enterobacteriaceae.
Both IMP and VIM hydrolyse all Î²-lactams except monobactams, and evade all Î²-lactam inhibitors.
OXA (oxacillinase) group of Î²-lactamases (Class D): The OXA group of Î²-lactamases occur mainly in Acinetobacter species and are divided into two clusters.
OXA carbapenemases hydrolyse carbapenems very slowly in vitro, and the high MICs seen for some Acinetobacter hosts (>64 mg/L) may reflect secondary mechanisms.
They are sometimes augmented in clinical isolates by additional resistance mechanisms, such as impermeability or efflux.
OXA carbapenemases also tend to have a reduced hydrolytic efficiency towards penicillins and cephalosporins.
KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A): A few class A enzymes, most noted the plasmid-mediated KPC enzymes, are effective carbapenemases as well.
Ten variants, KPC-2 through KPC-11 are known, and they are distinguished by one or two amino-acid substitutions The class A Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is currently the most common carbapenemase.
CMY (Class C): The first class C carbapenemase was described in 2006 and was isolated from a virulent strain of Enterobacter aerogenes.
It is carried on a plasmid, pYMG-1, and is therefore transmissible to other bacterial strains.

Forms of high molecular weight insulin-like growth factor-II ('Big IGF-2' and 'Big-big IGF-2') represent partially processed pro-IGF-2 and have a molecular weight of 10-18 kD in contrast to mature IGF-2, which has a molecular weight of 7.5 kD. The 10 and 12 kD high molecular weight forms are known as 'Big-IGF-2' and the 15 and 18 kDa forms are known as 'big big-IGF-2'.
Increased amounts of high molecular weight IGF-2 forms is present in patients with various forms of tumor-related hypoglycemia, including extrapancreatic tumor hypoglycemia (EPTH) and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH).
NICTH is characteristic of Doege-Potter syndrome (DPS), a paraneoplastic syndrome in which hypoglycemia is associated with the presence of one or more non-islet tumors in the pleural cavity.
The causes and contributing risk factors for the patient's current nutritional diagnosis.
Lead is toxic to many organs and tissues including the heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive and nervous systems.
It interferes with the development of the nervous system and is particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent learning and behavior disorders.
Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headache, anemia, irritability, and in severe cases seizures, coma, and death.
Routes of exposure include contaminated air, water, soil, food, and consumer products.
Occupational exposure is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults.
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that more than 3 million workers in the United States are potentially exposed to lead in the workplace.
One of the largest threats to children is lead paint that exists in many older homes.
Blood lead levels screen for lead poisoning and monitor treatment as well.
The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the standard elevated blood lead level for adults to be 10 Âµg/dl of the whole blood.
For children the number is set much lower at 5 Âµg/dl of blood as of 2012 down from a previous 10 Âµg/dl.
The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and chelation therapy.
Both capillary and venous blood specimens are used for lead testing and they have different reference ranges, so it is important to distinguish the specimen type for both clinical and public health reporting.
Capillary samples are more likely to be contaminated by environmental residues present on the skin.
Venous blood collected using evacuated tubes and needles certified as lead-free is preferred (NCCLS.2001), however obtaining venous samples from pediatric patients may be be difficult, capillary blood from a finger puncture may be used for screening purposes.
If an elevated lead level is detected in capillary blood, a second test on a venous sample is necessary.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the mosquito-borne alphavirus genus, in the family Togaviridae, and was first observed in epidemic form in Africa.
Serologically, CHIKV belongs to the Semliki Forest (SF) subgroup of alphaviruses.
Infection in humans is characterized by rash, high fever and, its hallmark feature, severe arthritis that can persist for years.
CHIKV is a small, spherical, enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus.
The virion consists of an envelope and a nucleocapsid.
The envelope glycoproteins of alphaviruses are the distinguishing factors for testing.
The CHIKV genome encodes for two polyproteins; the non-structural polyprotein consisting of four proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) and the structural polyprotein consisting of five proteins (Capsid, E3, E2, 6K and E1).
CHIKV has spikes on the virion surface that are each formed by three E1-E2 heterodimers, where the E1 glycoproteins mediate fusion and E2 glycoproteins interact with the host receptor.
CHIKV can be detected between the first and fourth day of infection (the acute phase) using PCR or virus cultivation, and virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies can be detected during the 8th to the 10th day of infection.
Antibody investigation should be performed using serum samples from the acute and convalescent stage.

Cheese is one of the most important allergens involved in food allergy in adults.
Deletions on the long arm of chromosome Y are known to be associated with male infertility, frequently due to non-obstructive idiopathic azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia.
Tiepolo and Zuffardi (Human Genetics, v34,1976) reported that 0.5% of idiopathic sub infertile individuals were found to carry cytogenetically visible deletions on the Yqll region.
They called this region the 'azoospermia factor (AZF)'.
To date, three primary AZF regions have been named: AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc.
The AZFa region is found within Yq11.21, AZFb and AZFc more distally within Yq11.22, 23.
Molecular techniques, including multiplex PCR and Y-chromosome locus-specific probes, may used to detect small non-overlapping interstitial deletions within the AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions.

The Mandarin is a small, deep-orange-colored Orange.
The skin is loose and easily peeled.
The Mandarin Orange is considered a native of southeastern Asia and the Philippines.
It is most abundantly grown in Japan, southern China, India, and the East Indies.
These fruits have never been as popular in Western countries as they are in the Orient.
For commercial exploitation, Mandarins have several disadvantages, including that, unlike the Orange, the fruit does not ship well.
But increasing cultivation in non-Eastern tropical areas has led to increasing availability.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Mandarin may occasionally induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals; however, few studies have been reported to date.
Clinical presentation of citrus fruit allergy, reported mostly for Orange, is heterogeneous, varing from mild oral allergy syndrome to severe anaphylaxis.
Peptoniphilus species, previously classified as Peptostreptococcus, are Gram positive anaerobic bacteria.
Peptoniphilus species have been identified as pathogens in various types of infections including chronic wounds such as those related to diabetes, pressure ulcers, bone and joint infections, sinus infections, and genitourinary infections.
Dry body weight is the body weight of a hemodialysis patient post-dialysis, when the blood pressure is within normal limits without the use of antihypertensive medication.
In patients with renal failure, decline in kidney function leads to increased total body sodium, which causes an increase in extracellular fluid volume (ECV) and hypertension.
During dialysis, excess sodium and fluid is removed, with a consequent decrease in blood pressure.
Recommended values for blood pressure are pre-dialysis pressure of <140/90 and post-dialysis pressure of <130/85, which indicate adequate volume control.
Dry body weight can help monitor ECV but is difficult to determine since it is not a constant value and may vary between hemodialysis sessions.
Other methods for measuring ECV include central venous pressure, examination of the external jugular vein, assessment of edema, and the cardiothoracic index.
Coagulation factor inhibitors can develop in patients with coagulation factor deficiencies after receiving factor therapy as well as in response to various antibiotics, chemotherapy and other conditions such as autoimmune disorders.

The superior angle formed by the long axis of the maxillary central incisor and the Nasion-Subspinale (A point) line
Threonine, one of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids, is nutritionally essential in humans because they cannot synthesze it.
Threonine contains two chiral centers, so there are four possible stereoisomers of threonine, or two possible diastereomers of L-threonine.
However, the name L-threonine is used for one single enantiomer, (2 S ,3 R)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid.
The second diastereomer (2 S ,3 S), which is rarely present in nature, is called L-allo-threonine.
The threonine side chain can undergo O-linked glycosylation.
Threonine can become phosphorylated through the action of a threonine kinase.
In its phosphorylated form, it is referred to as phosphothreonine.
Foods high in threonine are cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, lentils, and sesame seeds.
Threonine is a secondary marker for citrullinemia type II, an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic products to accumulate in the blood.

The biparietal diameter (BPD) measurement, using outer-to-outer caliper positioning, is dependent on the head shape of the fetus (using the cephalic index).
Due to inaccuracies that can occur with this measurement, the BPD is no longer routinely used for gestational age estimation or determining the appropriateness of fetal size later in pregnancy.
Head circumference is the preferred method for measuring fetal head size.
Ribonuclease P, RNase P) is a type of ribonuclease which cleaves RNA.
RNase P is unique from other RNases in that it is a ribozyme - a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way that a protein based enzyme would.
Its function is to cleave off an extra, or precursor, sequence of RNA on tRNA molecules.
Further, RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome), the discovery of which earned Sidney Altman and Thomas Cech the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1989: in the 1970s, Altman discovered the existence of precursor tRNA with flanking sequences and was the first to characterize RNase P and its activity in processing of the 5' leader sequence of precursor tRNA.
Recent findings also reveal that RNase P has a new function.
It has been shown that human nuclear RNase P is required for the normal and efficient transcription of various small noncoding RNAs, such as tRNA, 5S rRNA, SRP RNA and U6 snRNA genes., which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, one of three major nuclear RNA polymerases in human cells.
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to evaluate the functionality of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.
The aPTT can only detect deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII and only if the deficiency is 20-40% of normal.
The aPTT clotting time can vary depending upon a number of factors including its activator composition, the platelet phospholipid substitute, the calcium chloride concentration, and incubation time.
All of these various properties also affect how sensitive the aPTT is at detecting clotting factor deficiencies, either functional or quantitative.
Some aPTT reagents have been found to be more sensitive in being able to detect most of the factor VIII, IX, and XI deficiencies.
An aPTT assay is run using patient plasma that is diluted with pooled normal plasma to determine if there is a factor deficiency or an inhibitor.
The detection limits of factor deficient plasma can be obtained from the reagent manufacturer for specific instruments.
It is also possible to develop a detection limit by testing at least 20 factor deficient specimens that have activities that range from 10 to 50% for each of the intrinsic coagulation factors.
The Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), is a pelagic schooling species of mackerel found on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean.
The species is also called Boston mackerel, or just mackerel.
Retinol and retinyl esters are the two most abundant forms of retinoid present in the diet.
Retinyl esters are formed when a fatty acyl group is esterified to the hydroxyl terminus of retinol, a storage form of retinol.
The most abundant retinyl esters in the body are linoleic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid.
In biochemistry, beta-alanine is the only naturally occurring beta amino acid, which are amino acids in which the amino group is at the -position from the carboxylate group (i.e., two atoms away).
The IUPAC name for beta-alanine would be 3-aminopropionic acid.
Unlike its normal counterpart, L-alanine, beta-alanine has no chiral center.
beta-alanine is not used in the biosynthesis of any major proteins or enzymes.
It is formed in vivo by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine.
It is a component of the naturally occurring peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (Vitamin B-5) which itself is a component of coenzyme A. Under normal conditions, beta-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid.

The three peptides include the A chain, B chain, and C-peptide.
When the A and B chains are joined by a disulfide bond they become the hormone insulin.
Insulin binds to the insulin receptors (INSR) on cells in the body to stimulate the uptake of glucose.
In addition to decreasing the level of glucose in the blood, insulin also increases the permeability of cells to amino and fatty acids, and accelerates glycolysis and glycogen synthesis in the liver.

Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) is a non-enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with a single serotype PSV-1.
The only known hosts are domestic swine and wild boar.
Transmission of PSV is through the fecal-oral route and no humans are known to have been infected.
Infections can be asymptomatic but can also lead to neurological disorders, diarrhea, pneumonia, stillbirth, mummified fetus, embryonic death and infertility.
PSV has been identified in healthy swine in Brazil, Australia, Spain, Italy and the United States.
Symptomatic infection of PSV has been reported in China, South Korea and the United Kingdom.
Tests that identify PSV include culture, virus neutralization and reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RT-PCR is used to distinguish between PSV, Porcine teschovirus (PTV) and Enterovirus G (EV-G).PSV can be inactivated with sodium chlorite and 70% ethanol.
There is no treatment or vaccine for PSV.
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis (affects primarily domestic livestock, but can be passed to humans) causing fever.
It is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes.
The disease is caused by the RVF virus, a member of the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae).
The disease was first reported among livestock in Kenya around 1915, but the virus was not isolated until 1931.
RVF outbreaks occur across sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks occurring elsewhere infrequently (but sometimes severely - in Egypt in 1977 -78, several million people were infected and thousands died during a violent epidemic; in September 2000 an outbreak was confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen).
In humans the virus can cause several different syndromes.
Usually sufferers have either no symptoms or only a mild illness with fever, headache, myalgia and liver abnormalities.
The PCSK9 gene (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is located on chromosome 1p32.3.
This gene encodes a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, which includes proteases that process protein and peptide precursors trafficking through regulated or constitutive branches of the secretory pathway.
The encoded protein undergoes an autocatalytic processing event with its prosegment in the ER and is constitutively secreted as an inactive protease into the extracellular matrix and trans-Golgi network.
It is expressed in liver, intestine and kidney tissues and escorts specific receptors for lysosomal degradation.
It plays a role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Cyclosporine (Brand names Neoral, Restasis, Sandimmune, Gengraf) is a cyclic undecapeptide of fungal origin and a potent calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive agent.
The introduction of cyclosporine in human organ transplantation substantially improved patient and graft survival in patients receiving heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, lung or bone marrow transplants.
Cyclosporine was the first drug to specifically and reversibly inhibit the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes.
The main mechanism through which cyclosporine exerts its immunosuppressive effect is the inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation.
Monitoring and concentration-controlled dosing is required to maintain patient drug levels within a narrow therapeutic window; low levels could cause transplant rejection and high levels may cause nephrotoxicity.
The PAX8/PPARG (paired box 8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) gene rearrangement is created by a translocation between chromosome arms 2q and 3p where the entire coding region of the PPARG transcription factor gene is fused with the first 8 to 10 exons of the PAX8 gene.
Translocations of the PAX8/PPARG genes play a role in the pathogenesis of some follicular thyroid carcinomas and follicular-variant papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Several testing methods are used to detect the rearrangement, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
Mutations of the MBL2 gene can lead to mannose-binding lectin deficiency.

Garlic (Allium sativum) is a perennial plant in the family Alliaceae and genus Allium, closely related to the onion, shallot, and leek.
It does not grow in the wild, and is thought to have arisen in cultivation, probably descended from the species Allium longicuspis, which grows wild in south-western Asia.
Garlic has been used throughout all of recorded history for both culinary and medicinal purposes.
The portion of the plant most often consumed is an underground storage structure called a head.
A head of garlic is composed of a dozen or more discrete cloves, each of which is a botanical bulb, an underground structure comprised of thickened leaf bases.
Each garlic clove may often be composed of just one leaf base, unlike onions, which almost always have multiple layers.
The above-ground portions of the garlic plant are also sometimes consumed, particularly while immature and tender.
Garlic has a powerful pungent or hot flavor when raw, which mellows considerably when it is cooked.

The genus flavivirus (FV) is a group of single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses whose vectors are mainly ticks and mosquitoes.
They are dispersed worldwide and infect as many as 400 million people each year.
The FVs that cause neurotropic disease infect the brain and spinal cord leading to serious neurological disorders including meningitis, encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis.
The neurotropic FV include West Nile Virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Usutu virus, Ilheus virus, and Zika virus.
The visceral disease causing FV can lead to liver failure, hemorrhagic syndromes and vascular damage and include yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus.
Zika virus is the only FV that infects the human reproductive tract and can be sexually transmitted.
If Zika infects a pregnant mother, resulting placental damage can allow the virus to infect the fetus and cause placental insufficiency, microcephaly, congenital malformations, and fetal demise.

Tests for presence of mecA gene using genomic methods.
When present, the mecA gene confers resistance to cephalosporins or methicillin.
Parasitism is one version of symbiosis (living together), a phenomenon in which two organisms which are phylogenetically unrelated co-exist over a prolonged period of time, usually their entire life.
The requirement for a prolonged interaction precludes predatory or episodic interactions (such as a mosquito feeding on a host), which are usually not seen as symbiotic relationships.
Symbiosis encompasses commensalism (eating at the same table, wherein two organisms co-exist in the same space, and one organism benefits while neither harming nor helping the other), through mutualism (wherein both species benefit from the interaction) to parasitism, wherein one organism, usually physically smaller of the two (the parasite) benefits and the other (the host) is harmed.
(Various forms of social parasitism, kleptoparasitism, and cheating parasitism, as discussed below, are characterized by a less close association between parasite and host, however.
Rickettsia africae is a species of Rickettsia.

The Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging zoonotic infection in Queensland, Australia.
HeV is a Henipavirus that commonly infects Pteropid fruit bats, and more recently, horses, humans, and sporadically to date, dogs.
The mode of transmission is believed to be HeV particles in bat urine that are directly taken up by an intermediate host.
Transmission of HeV from horses to humans likely, occurs via spread of aerosolized infectious droplets during the final stages of the infection.
In humans, HeV infection initially presents with general respiratory symptoms, followed by fulminant encephalitis occurring many months later.
The case fatality rate in humans is approximately 60%.

Bellis perennis is a common European species of Daisy, often considered the archetypal species of that name.
Many related plants also share the name "Daisy", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as Common Daisy, Lawn Daisy or occasionally English daisy.
It is native to western, central and northern Europe.
The species is widely naturalised in North America, and also in South America.
Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), also called plasma lipid transfer protein, is a plasma protein that facilitates the transport of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between the lipoproteins.
It collects triglycerides from very low-density (VLDL) or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and exchanges them for cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and vice versa.
Most of the time, however, CETP does a homoexchange, trading a triglyceride for a triglyceride or a cholesteryl ester for a cholesteryl ester.
Rare mutations leading to increased function of CETP have been linked to accelerated atherosclerosis.
In contrast, a polymorphism (I405V) of the CETP gene leading to lower serum levels has also been linked to exceptional longevity and to metabolic response to nutritional intervention.
However, this mutation also increases the prevalence of coronary heart disease in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.
The D442G mutation, which lowers CETP levels and increases HDL levels also increases coronary heart disease.
Elaidic acid, a major component of trans fat, increases CETP activity.

It is also known as the multicolored Asian lady beetle, and Halloween lady beetle
A psychoactive compound extracted from the resin of cannabis sativa (marihuana, hashish).
The isomer delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is considered the most active form, producing characteristic mood and perceptual changes associated with this compound.
Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-THC.
Norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine),a major metabolite of clozapine, is pharmacologically active.
The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well.
Agents which induce (e.g. cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g. theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine.
For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.

This species is found almost everywhere malaria is endemic and is the only one that has a range extending into the temperate regions.
Amisulpride is a derivative of substituted benzamide and a second generation antipsychotic drug used to treat chronic schizophrenia.
Low doses of amisulpride promote neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors D2 and D3.
High doses of amisulpride reduce dopaminergic transmission by binding the postsynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 receptors more favorably in the limbic system.
Blocking the postsynaptic D2 and D3 receptors in the limbic system is highly prognostic of powerful antipsychotic activity.
Some data suggests that amisulpride is also effective in patients with dysthymia.
Side effects to amisulpride include a low incidence of cardiac toxicity, hypotension, sedation, anticholinergic symptoms, weight gain and extrapyramidal side effects.
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential nutrients that include eicosapentaenoate (EPA), docosahexaenoate (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).
They are made up of 18-22 carbon atoms with the first double bond at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid structure.
EPA and DHA are found primarily in fatty fish including salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines and in algae and krill.
ALA is present in plant oils including flaxseed, soybean, and canola oils.
There are many health benefits from maintaining a good level of omega-3 fatty acids including reduced inflammation, risk of heart disease, cancer, arthritis, and many more.
Deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids can result in fatigue, poor memory, dry skin, heart problems, mood swings, and poor circulation.
The GJB1 gene (gap junction protein, beta 1, 32kDa) is located on chromosome Xq13.1.
This gene encodes a member of the gap junction protein family.
The gap junction proteins are membrane-spanning proteins that assemble to form gap junction channels that facilitate the transfer of ions and small molecules between cells.
According to sequence similarities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, the gap junction proteins are divided into two categories, alpha and beta.
Mutations in this gene cause X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited peripheral neuropathy.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.
Saturated fats are fat molecules that have no double bonds between carbon molecules because they are saturated with hydrogen molecules.
Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature.
Eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in your blood.
Many foods high in saturated fats can be high in calories too.
Saturated fats occur naturally in many foods, mainly from animal sources, including meat and dairy products.
Alpha-1-microglobulin (also called protein HC or A1M) is a 31-kD, single-chain plasma glycoprotein that may be involved in regulation of the inflammatory process.
The alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor gene (AMBP) codes for a precursor that splits into alpha-1-microglobulin, which belongs to the lipocalin superfamily, and bikunin.
A1M is normally present as a free form and as a complex with IgA in the blood, spinal fluid, and urine.
A1M inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis to endotoxin-activated serum.
Abnormal plasma/serum levels can be seen in liver or kidney disorders, and also in clinical conditions such as HIV and mood disorders.
Urinary A1M is used for the early detection and monitoring of kidney tubular disorders such as heavy metal intoxications, diabetic nephropathy, urinary outflow disorders or pyelonephritis).
Increased urinary excretion of Î±1-microglobulin in tubular proteinuria indicates reduced tubular reabsorption under normal glomerular filtration conditions.
This form of proteinuria is typical for chronic interstitial nephropathy and for acute and chronic tubular damage caused by endogenous and exogenous tubular toxins.
In renal failure, plasma levels of this microprotein increase from an early stage.
The resultant protein hyperfiltration in the residual nephron causes increased renal excretion as re-absorption capacity is exceeded.
Î±1-Microglobulin can be used as a marker to diagnose tubulo-interstitial nephropathy, for example, at an early stage, or rule it out with a high degree of certainty.
Acute and chronic forms of tubular insufficiency (all forms of primary and secondary Fanconi syndrome), heavy metal intoxication, nephrotoxic side-effects of pharmaceuticals, and rejection reactions following kidney transplantation can also be excluded.

The drug has been marketed under the name NRG-1, although only a minority of samples of substances sold under this name have been found to actually contain naphyrone.
Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug.
It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.
Along with expected sedative effects of relaxation and drowsiness ethchlorvynol can cause skin rashes, faintness, restlessness and euphoria.
Early adjustment side effects can include nausea and vomiting, numbness, blurred vision, stomach pains and temporary dizziness.
An overdose is marked by confusion, fever, peripheral numbness and weakness, reduced coordination and muscle control, slurred speech, reduced heartbeat.
It is addictive and after prolonged use can cause withdrawal symptoms including convulsions, hallucinations and memory loss.
Due to these problems it is unusual for ethchlorvynol to be prescribed for periods exceeding seven days.
Ethchlorvynol is a member of the class of sedative-hypnotic tertiary carbinols such as methylparafynol.
It is not a barbituric acid derivative.
Grapefruit is one of the three principle members of the citrus family.
Its origin is not clear but it may have come about as a hybrid of the pomelo tree and sweet orange.

IgE antibodies to Grapefruit were detected in patients with atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and bronchial asthma.
The Sweet potato, belonging to the Morning glory family and not related to Potatoes, is native to the West Indies and Central America, although early reports place it in Indonesia and Philippines too.
It is a vine-like, perennial herb but is cultivated as an annual.
It is now grown in more than 100 countries in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climates.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Sweet potato can occasionally induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals; however, no studies have been reported to date.
Methylestrenolone is an anabolic steroid.
Isocyanate is the functional group of atoms N=C=O (1 nitrogen, 1 carbon, 1 oxygen), not to be confused with the cyanate functional group which is arranged as â¬"Oâ¬"CN.
Any organic compound which contains an isocyanate group may also be referred to in brief as an isocyanate.
An isocyanate may have more than one isocyanate group.
An isocyanate that has two isocyanate groups is known as a diisocyanate.
Diisocyanates are manufactured for reaction with polyols in the production of polyurethanes.

Generally refers to the 17-beta-isomer of estradiol, an aromatized C18 steroid with hydroxyl group at 3-beta- and 17-beta-position.
Estradiol-17-beta is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids.
In humans, it is produced primarily by the cyclic ovaries and the placenta.
It is also produced by the adipose tissue of men and postmenopausal women.
The 17-alpha-isomer of estradiol binds weakly to estrogen receptors and exhibits little estrogenic activity in estrogen-responsive tissues.
Various isomers can be synthesized.
The PSEN2 gene (presenilin 2) is located on chromosome 1q42.13.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with an inherited form of the disease carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1 or PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP).
These disease-linked mutations result in increased production of the longer form of amyloid-beta (main component of amyloid deposits found in AD brains).
Presenilins are postulated to regulate APP processing through their effects on gamma-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves APP.
Also, it is thought that the presenilins are involved in the cleavage of the Notch receptor such that, they either directly regulate gamma-secretase activity, or themselves act are protease enzymes.
Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms of PSEN2 have been identified.
Thyrotropin (TSH) has three codes in LOINC which differ by their detection limits.
The so-called first-generation TSH test was of low sensitivity, such that it was not useful for diagnosing or following hyperthyroidism.
It is no longer commercially available.
LOINC has a code with no specified detection limit.
3016-3 Thyrotropin in Serum or Plasma This code has existed since the first release of LOINC (in 1994).
Today you should avoid mapping to it except when you are mapping old TSH tests whose sensitivity cannot be ascertained.
2) The so-called 2nd generation TSH has a detection limit of <= .05 mIU/L and is now the routine TSH test in most settings.
11579-0 Thyrotropin in Serum or Plasma by Detection limit <= 0.05 mIU/L
It has the advantage over earlier tests in that it can detect both hyperthyroidism (reflected by an abnormally low TSH) and hypothyroidism, reflected by an abnormally high TSH. 3)
A third-generation TSH with a detection limit of <= .005 mIU/L also exists.
Labs usually add high sensitivity or ultra-sensitive or 3rd generation to its name.
It only offers advantage over the 2nd generation test in special cases.
Because of its limited measurement range at the high end, it can require more work (extra dilution steps) to quantify the value of very high TSH levels, but it is widely available.

FIP-infected kidney showing inflammatory responseFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease that affects cats.
It is believed by some to be caused by Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV) - (Felin Coronavirus FeCoV).
Although there appears to be a connection between FIP and feline coronavirus, no clear cause and effect has yet been proven.
Experts do not always agree on the specifics of FIP.
However, the most common theory is that the normally benign FECV mutates into FIPV.
The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages.

The p53 antigen was first discovered in 1979 and recognized as a tumor repressive gene in 1989.
It encodes a protein that monitors the cell cycle by suppressing tumor growth and preventing genome mutation.
When p53 is defective, abnormal cell proliferation can occur.
Mutations in p53 are present in up to 50% of all human tumors.
The three major functions of p53 include growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
P53 halts the growth arrest function of the cell cycle progress which can activate transcription of proteins that repair DNA.
There are low levels of p53 in normal cells, but damage to DNA and similar stress signals may precipitate an increase of p53 protein.
Cell death is the final course of action to prevent cells containing abnormal DNA from dividing.
The concentration of P53 in cells is probably tightly controlled since high concentrations may accelerate aging due to excess apoptosis.
Ongoing studies are investigating the utility of the p53 antibody being used as a biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer in high risk asymptomatic patients.
Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family.

There are two forms of the PDGFR-- alpha and beta -- each encoded by a different gene.
Depending on which growth factor is bound, PDGFR homo- or heterodimerizes.
Like many other growth factors that have been linked to disease, PDGF and its receptors have provided a market for receptor antagonists to treat disease.
Such antagonists include (but are not limited to) specific antibodies that target the molecule of interest, which act only in a neutralizing manner.

Homocystine is the double-bonded form of homocysteine, but it occurs only transiently before being converted to the harmless cystathionine via a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme.
Homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide account for >98% of total homocysteine in plasma from healthy individuals.
Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is thought to be a major factor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.
Elevated plasma homocysteine is an accepted risk factor for atherosclerosis, and may act through LDL oxidation, although this is controversial.
However, the major thiol in plasma is cysteine, which is present at concentrations approximately 10 times greater than homocysteine; therefore homocystine in plasma is insignificant, and consequently homocystine is unlikely to influence LDL oxidation in vivo.
Increasing evidence supports a role for an elevation of homocysteine in schizophrenia.
It has been demonstrated that neural tube defects are related to a genetic defect in homocysteine metabolism.
Sufficient intake of folic acid is believed to reduce this risk by enhancing methylation of homocysteine and its conversion to methionine, thereby compensating for this genetic defect.
Plasma homocysteine levels are elevated when folate levels are in the lower half of the normal range.
Phenylpropionylglycine is an acyl glycine.
Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids.
However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine.
The detection of phenylpropionylglycine in urine after an oral load of phenylpropionic acid can be used to diagnose deficiency of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a frequent and treatable metabolic defect.

Used to detect hyper and hypo aldosteronisnm.
Hypoaldosteronism can occur in any condition that causes destruction or dysfunction of the adrenal gland.1,2,4 Hypoaldosterism can be due to primary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, acquired secondary aldosterone deficiency (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism), and acquired Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is the most common form of isolated hypoaldosteronism and is results from impaired renin release from the kidney.
Congenital hypoaldosteronism caused by inherited enzymatic defects in aldosterone biosynthesis are rare.
Corticosterone methyloxidase I (CMO I) deficiency is associated with elevated serum levels of corticosterone and low levels of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone and aldosterone.
Corticosterone methyloxidase II (CMO II) deficiency produces high levels of 18-hydroxy-corticosterone, the immediate precursor of aldosterone.
Acquired primary hypoaldosteronism can be caused by the administration of heparin.
Also, persistently hypotensive, critically ill patients with sepsis, pneumonia, peritonitis, cholangitis, and liver failure can have inappropriately low plasma aldosterone concentrations in relation to elevated plasma renin activity.
Primary hyperaldosteronism, also referred to as Conn syndrome, is due to overproduction of aldosterone by one or both of the adrenal glands.
Some recent studies suggest that 10% to 15% of Hyper thyroidism cases are due to (or associated with) primary hyperaldosteronism.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism is relatively common and can occur as the result of any condition that decreases blood flow to the kidneys (ie, renal artery stenosis), decreases blood pressure, or lowers plasma sodium levels.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism may also be seen with cirrhosis, congestive heart failure.
and toxemia of pregnancy.
Several studies have suggested that high-normal aldosterone levels predict development of high blood pressure in normotensive subjects and that increased aldosterone action contributes to hypertension, cardiovascular fibrosis, and cardiac hypertrophy.

Watermelon is widely grown in tropical and sub-tropical climates, and is an especially popular seasonal fruit in the southern United States.
The plant has trailing vines and very large fruit (commonly up to half a metre long) with smooth, thick, green skin, and sometimes darker green stripes.
The flesh is sweet, and pink, red or yellow in color.
Watermelon may uncommonly induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Allergic reactions include oral allergy syndrome or oropharyngeal symptoms (itching and/or swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, dermatitis, angioedema, and dyspnoea
An ocular motility exam is an examination of the movements of the eyes.

Ezogabine or Retigabine, also known ad D-23129, is an anticonvulsant used as a treatment for partial epilepsies.
Its primary active metabolite is N-acetyl ezogabine.
Ezogabine works primarily as a potassium channel opener-that is, by activating a certain family of voltage-gated potassium channels in the brain.
This mechanism of action is unique among antiepileptic drugs, and may hold promise for the treatment of other neurologic conditions, including migraine, tinnitus and neuropathic pain.
Parvovirus B19 (B19 virus) was the first (and, until 2005, only) human parvovirus to be discovered, by chance in 1975 by the Australian virologist Yvonne Cossart.
The name B19 refers to the location of the virus in the Petri dish where it was growing initially.
Parvovirus B19 is best known for causing a childhood exanthem called fifth disease or erythema infectiosum.
The GNAS1 gene (GNAS complex locus) gene is located on chromosome 20q13.3.
This locus has a highly complex imprinted expression pattern.
It gives rise to maternally, paternally, and biallelically expressed transcripts that are derived from four alternative promoters and 5' exons.
Some transcripts contain a differentially methylated region (DMR) at their 5' exons, and this DMR is commonly found in imprinted genes and correlates with transcript expression.
An antisense transcript is produced from an overlapping locus on the opposite strand.
One of the transcripts produced from this locus, and the antisense transcript, are paternally expressed noncoding RNAs, and may regulate imprinting in this region.
In addition, one of the transcripts contains a second overlapping ORF, which encodes a structurally unrelated protein - Alex.
Alternative splicing of downstream exons is also observed, which results in different forms of the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit, a key element of the classical signal transduction pathway linking receptor-ligand interactions with the activation of adenylyl cyclase and a variety of cellular reponses.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Mutations in this gene result in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, McCune-Albright syndrome, progressive osseus heteroplasia, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, and some pituitary tumors.

Patients with autoimmune inner ear disease AIED typically experience hearing loss and tinnitus over several months, but variations of the onset of AIED can include bilateral attacks of hearing loss, attacks of dizziness, and the presence of autoantibodies.
The hair cells in the inner are commonly affected and damage to them leads to hearing loss and problems with balance.
The cause of AIED is believed to be due to damage of the inner ear from autoantibodies or immune cells and cytokines due to inflammation.
Viral or bacterial infections may induce the production of antibodies that cross react with inner ear antigens.
Seventy percent of patients diagnosed with autoimmune hearing loss test positive for antibodies to the 68kD inner ear antigen.
The antibody level correlates with the severity of the disease.
The majority of patients with 68kD inner ear antigen autoantibodies respond well to corticosteroid treatment.
Angiotensin (1-7) is an active heptapeptide (amino acid sequence: Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro) of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a pathway involved in the regulation of cardiovascular physiology.
It is part of a group of peptides with amino acid sequence and biological function similar to angiotensin-(1-8) octapeptide (Angiotensin II).
The amino acid sequence of angiotensin-(1-10) decapeptide (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu) serves as reference for all angiotensin peptides.
Ang (1-7) is a product of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and can be produced from metabolism of both Angiotensin II and Angiotensin I via different pathways.
Both ACE2 and Ang (1-7) are thought to have counteracting effects against other RAS components, such as angiotensin II.
Several studies have found that Ang (1-7) and ACE2 have protective effects in the heart and blood vessels and could serve as therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease.
Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, formerly known as Micropolyspora faeni, is an aerobic, thermophilic, gram-positive and filamentous bacterial strain that produces short chains of spores both on substrates and on aerial mycelia.
S. rectivirgula can be found in soil and moldy hay, and its airborne spores are known to cause exogen allergic alveolitis (EAA, a type of hypersensitive pneumonitis).
S. rectivirgula spores exist in large numbers in compost facilities, mushroom cultivation, barns, and rooms with technical air moistening.
Farmer's lung disease, another form of hypersensitive pheumonitis, is one of the most common causes of S. rectivirgula, especially in eastern Canada.
It has also been associated with a respiratory disease in horses known as heaves.
The T cell receptor or TCR is a molecule found on the surface of T lymphocytes (or T cells) that is, in general, responsible for recognizing antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.
The TCR is composed of two different protein chains (that is, it is a heterodimer).
In 95% of T cells, this consists of an alpha (Î±) chain (TCRA gene) and beta (Î²) chain (TCRB gene), whereas in 5% of T cells this consists of gamma (Î³) chain (TCRG gene) and delta (Î´) chain (TCRD gene).
When the TCR engages with antigen and MHC, this activates the T lymphocyte through a series of biochemical events mediated by associated enzymes, co-receptors, specialized accessory molecules and activated or released transcription factors.
Type-IV collagen is a type of collagen found primarily in the basal lamina.
The type IV collagen C4 domain at the C-terminus is not removed in post-translational processing, and the fibers link head-to-head, rather than in parallel.
Also, type-IV lacks the regular glycine in every third residue necessary for the tight, collagen helix.
This makes the overall arrangement more sloppy with kinks.
These two features cause the collagen to form in a sheet, the form of the basal lamina.
The alpha 3 protein constituent of type-IV collagen is thought to be the antigen implicated in Goodpasture's syndrome, wherein the immune system attacks the basement membranes of the glomeruli and the alveoli.
Mutations to the genes coding for type-IV collagen lead to Alport syndrome.

Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stoke like episodes syndrome (MELAS) gene mutation causes detection of an A to G point mutation at base pair 3243 in the mitochondrial tRNA Leucine (MTTL1) gene.
Potentia Hydrogenii, commonly known as pH, is a quantitative measurement of the acidity or basicity of a substance.
A substance's pH value is based on a relative scale from 1-14 depending on the substance's proton ion concentration (H+).
A higher proton ion concentration results in a lower pH value.
Therefore, a pH value between 0 and 7 is an acidic substance whereas a pH value between 7 and 14 is an alkaline/basic substance.
A pH value of exactly 7 is a neutral substance.
The specific pH value of the blood is crucial in maintaining bodily functions.
When the blood pH value is below normal range it is called acidosis.
When the blood pH value is above normal range, it is called alkadosis.
Acidosis/alkadosis can be divided into two categories: metabolic and respiratory.
Oxytetracycline was the second of the broad-spectrum tetracycline group of antibiotics to be discovered.
Oxytetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is active against a wide variety of bacteria.
However, some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic, which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infection.
Oxytetracycline is still used to treat infections caused by chlamydia (e.g. the chest infection psittacosis, the eye infection trachoma, and the genital infection urethritis) and infections caused by mycoplasma organisms (e.g. pneumonia).
Oxytetracycline is used to treat acne, due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that cause acne (Propionebacterium acnes).
It is used to treat flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, due to its activity against the bacteria usually responsible, Haemophilus influenzae.
Oxytetracycline may also be used to treat other rarer infections, such as those caused by a group of micro-organisms called rickettsiae (e.g. Q fever).
To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to oxytetracycline a tissue sample is usually taken, for example a swab from the infected area, or a urine or blood sample.
Ganglioside GT1a is a central nervous system ganglioside that is present in several cranial nerves, including oculomotor, glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves.

Fenproporex has never been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sale in the US due to lack of efficacy and safety data.
Fenproporex is on the list of substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and any sportsperson testing positive for the substance faces a ban from competition
Canis familiaris (Can f) 4 is a dog dander allergen.
Dog dander consists of the very small pieces of epithelium that flake off the dog and can remain airborne for hours.
Dog dander has the highest concentration of allergens of any source from the dog.
The rate of epidermal turnover varies with the age of the dog and whether the dog suffers from seborrhea, which increases turnover from 21 days to 3-4 days.
The most significant dog allergen is Can f 1.
Can f 4 is a less important dog dander allergen.
The Canadian Triage and Acuity Score (CTAS) is a 5-level scale designed to support triage nurses prioritize ED patients based on acuity and time sensitive conditions.
It is built on a 17 group, 166 standardized complaints, each of which draws on a list of first order (vital sign, pain score, mechanism of injury, and bleeding risk) modifiers and complaint specific special modifiers to assign the most appropriate acuity score and to then stream patients to the right care area.
For patient safety and quality of care it is recommended for CTAS level 1 to be seen immediately, CTAS 2 within 15 minutes, CTAS 3 within 30 minutes, CTAS 4 within 1 hour and CTAS 5 within 2 hours.

Veterinary Medicine: Porcine parainfluenza virus 1 (PPIV1) is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus found only in domestic pigs.
PPIV1 was first identified in Hong Kong in samples collected between 2008 and 2012.
In 2013, the virus was discovered in clinical specimens of pigs with respiratory disease in the United States.
There have been no known infections of PPIV1 in humans.
PPIV1 is transmitted in respiratory secretions and symptoms of infection include lethargy, coughing and sneezing with serous nasal discharge.
Pigs less than 21 days old are most likely to be symptomatic when infected.
Some asymptomatic pigs have tested positive for the virus.
PPIV1 has not been cultured in cells but it can be seen in respiratory tissue using in situ hybridization and quantified using RT-PCR assays.
Assays that identify antibodies to PPIV1 include immunoprecipitation coupled with PCR detection (ICPD) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a recombinant fusion (F) protein peptide (PPIV1 F ELISA).
There are currently no vaccines for PPIV1 available.
The fusion F protein mediates the union and penetration of the virus into the cell.

A uronic acid is a sugar acid with both a carbonyl and a carboxylic acid function.
It is best thought of as a sugar in which the terminal carbon's hydroxyl function has been oxidized to a carboxylic acid.
(Oxidation of the terminal aldehyde instead yields an aldonic acid while oxidation of both the terminal hydroxyl group and the aldehyde yields an aldaric acid.)
The names of uronic acids are generally based on their parent sugars, however some of the most common do not have direct parents, and are formed by epimerization (e.g iduronic acid is an epimer of glucuronic acid).
Copper is an essential trace mineral present in all body tissue and works with iron to help the body form red blood cells.

The onset of adverse reactions in the first 2 conditions may be immediate, delayed, or both immediate and delayed.
The most important House dust mites are Dermatophagoides farinae, which is more common in drier areas, and D. pteronyssinus.
D. farinae has many of the same characteristics as D. pteronyssinus, which co-exists with the Storage mite Blomia tropicalis in subtropical and tropical regions as a major source of allergens.
Recent evidence shows that even these very general boundaries are blurring and that in many instances all 3 mite species may be highly relevant, causing frequent sensitisation.
House dust mites cause symptoms such as perennial-type asthma, rhinitis and conjunctivitis, often with nocturnal or early morning episodes
The polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase enzyme is one of the determinants of the virulence of influenza viruses.

CHr can be used, along with other reticulocyte indices such as mean reticulocyte corpuscular volume (MCVr) to monitor treatment efficacy for various types of anemia, including sickle cell anemia treated with hydroxyurea, iron-deficiency anemia treated with IV iron, and various types of anemia treated with erythropoietin.
Vitamin A, a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal, and retinyl esters, is involved in immune function, vision, reproduction, and cellular communication.
Vitamin A is critical for vision and also supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs.
Two forms of vitamin A are available in the human diet: preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester) and provitamin A carotenoids.
Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver).
The various forms of vitamin A are solubilized into micelles in the intestinal lumen and absorbed by duodenal mucosal cells.
Most of the body's vitamin A is stored in the liver.
Concentrations of preformed vitamin A are highest in liver and fish oils.
Other sources of preformed vitamin A are milk and eggs, which also include some provitamin A. Most dietary provitamin
A comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils.

Homocarnosine, a normal metabolite, is the brain-specific dipeptide of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and histidine.
Homocarnosine, rather than carnosine, is the major imidazole dipeptide in human CSF and can be detected in the CSF of normal infants and young children, while either not detectable or present only in small amounts in the CSF of normal adults.
Slightly greater amounts can be found in the CSF of some adults with neurological disorders.
Homocarnosinosis (an inherited disorder), is characterized by an increased level of dipeptide homocarnosine (Hca) in CSF and the brain, and can co-exist with paraplegia, retinitis pigmentosa, and a progressive mental deficiency.

The ganglionic (alpha3-type) neuronal acetylcholine receptors (AChR) facilitate fast synaptic transmission in sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric autonomic ganglia.
Autoantibodies against ganglionic neuronal AChr are present in approximately 50% of patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG).
Their clinical features include orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal and bladder dysfunction, sicca symptoms, and impaired pupillary light reflex.
Like myasthenia gravis (MG), AAG is an antibody-mediated neurological disorder.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL6 gene.
IL-6 is an interleukin that acts as both a pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine.
It is secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response to trauma, especially burns or other tissue damage leading to inflammation.
In terms of host response to a foreign pathogen, IL-6 has been shown, in mice, to be required for resistance against the bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae.
IL-6 is also a "myokine," a cytokine produced from muscle, and is elevated in response to muscle contraction.
It is significantly elevated with exercise, and precedes the appearance of other cytokines in the circulation.
During exercise, it is thought to act in a hormone-like manner to mobilize extracellular substrates and/or augment substrate delivery.
Additionally, osteoblasts secrete IL-6 to stimulate osteoclast formation.
Smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of many blood vessels also produce IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a staph infection that is resistant to multiple antibiotics.
MRSA frequently causes skin infections, but can also cause pneumonia and, if untreated, can lead to sepsis.
MRSA is spread when a person comes in contact with an infected wound or by sharing personal items with a person infected with MRSA.
The risk of infection is increased in crowded spaces such as gyms, daycare centers, military bases, and patients being treated as inpatients in medical facilities.
Studies have shown that one in three people are asymptomatic carriers of staph in their nose and that two people in 100 are carriers of MRSA.
To prevent contracting MRSA, maintain good personal hygiene by frequently hand washing and bathing often, especially after exercise.
Keep scrapes and open wounds covered and get medical attention for skin infections.
MRSA infection of the skin may initially resemble a spider bite, but can become red, swollen, painful, warm to the touch, filled with pus, and accompanied by a fever.

Total lung capacity (TLC) is the volume of air in the lungs at maximum inflation.
TLC can be derived as the sum of the vital capacity (VC), the largest volume a patient can exhale after a full inhalation, and residual volume (RV), the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximum exhalation).
Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after normal exhalation.
Restrictive lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, generally lead to a decrease in various lung volumes, while obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma, are associated with preserved total volumes.
However, obstructive disease may be associated with high RV values, which may also be expressed as RV/TLC, which represents RV as a percentage of TLC.

Fluoxetine is also used (off-label) to treat many other conditions, such as ADHD.
Fluoxetine was derived from diphenhydramine, an antihistamine found to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
Compared to other popular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine has a strong energizing effect.
This makes fluoxetine highly effective in treatment of clinical depression cases where symptoms like depressed mood and lack of energy prevail.
Although stimulating, it is also approved for a variety of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder.
Cytopathic effect (CPE) refers to degenerative changes in cells (especially in tissue culture) associated with the multiplication of certain viruses.
When in tissue culture, the spread of virus is restricted by an overlay of agar (or other suitable substance) and thus the cytopathic effect may lead to formation of plaque.
Thus identification of a viral infection can be made by examining the characteristic cytopathic effect produced on different cell sheets.
This method however is relatively slow and not all viruses will grow on cell sheets.

The synovial membrane is divided into two compartments, the outer layer (subintima) and the inner layer (intima).
The intima is mainly composed of two cell types, specialized macrophage-like synovial cells and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), which maintain the internal joint homeostasis.
These cells represent the main source of hyaluronic acid and also other glycoproteins, major components of the synovial fluid.
Synovial lining cell hyperplasia is a typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and during the progression of this disease constant inflammatory processes take place in the synovial membrane, eventually leading to cartilage damage and joint destruction and deformation.
Due to the changes in proliferative and apoptotic processes the total number of cells increases in the synovium, and significantly increases also the number of fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
These cells, together with other immune cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, dendritic cells and platelets, create an inflammatory environment which attract even more immune cells to the damage area, and thus contribute to the joint destruction

Peanuts are the seeds of an annual legume, which grows close to the ground and produces its fruit below the soil surface.
This is in contrast to tree nuts like Walnuts and Almonds.
Peanut is a member of the Fabaceae or legume family, whereas tree nuts are not.
The Peanut plant is oval-leafed and about 45 cm tall.
Delicate yellow flowers develop around the lower portion.
The flowers pollinate themselves and then lose their petals as the fertilized ovary begins to enlarge.
The budding ovary or "peg" grows down toward the soil.
The Peanut embryo burrows into the soil surface and begins to mature, taking the form of the Peanut.
Peanut contains up to 32 different proteins, of which at least 18 have been identified as being capable of binding specific IgE. Varieties of Peanuts from different parts of the world contain similar proteins, including Ara h I and Ara h 2, and the IgE-binding properties have also been reported to be similar to a great extent.
Peanuts are a significant cause of serious food allergy in both adults and children.
Unlike other food allergies, Peanut allergy usually begins in childhood and persists throughout the affected individual's lifetime.
Peanut allergic reactions are more likely to be severe or even fatal than reactions to other food allergens.

The ATM gene (ATM serine/threonine kinase) is located on chromosome 11q22-q23.
The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the PI3/PI4-kinase family.
This protein is an important cell cycle checkpoint kinase that phosphorylates; thus, it functions as a regulator of a wide variety of downstream proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins p53 and BRCA1, checkpoint kinase CHK2, checkpoint proteins RAD17 and RAD9, and DNA repair protein NBS1.
This protein and the closely related kinase ATR are thought to be master controllers of cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that are required for cell response to DNA damage and for genome stability.
Mutations in this gene are associated with ataxia telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive disorder.
Cytochrome P450-2B6 (CYP2B6; ), a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, is involved in the metabolism of a number of clinically relevant substrates in current clinical use.

ProBNP is the 108 amino acid pro-hormone of BNP (Brain Naturetic Peptide) that is produced mainly in the left ventricle.
The prohormone splits into two polypeptides- the biologically active but shorter BNP (77-108) and the longer N terminal (1-76) fragment called NT-proBNP.
Commercial assays are available for NT-proBNP because of its usefulness in predicting cardiovascular risk.
In one study, it was the single best predictor of survival among patients with the acute coronary syndrome.
It also declines with successful treatment of left ventricular dysfunctionand heart failure and is used by some to track the success of such treatment.
No commercial assays exist for proBNP (the whole peptide)- though the trade name for one companies NT-proBNP is "proBNP" -- a misnomer.
We include proBNP as the a related name for NT-proBNP so that people who call it proBNP will find it in LOINC.

Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is an autoimmune disorder that is manifested by progressive central, peripheral and/or autonomic nervous system symptoms.
The neurological symptoms include encephalitis, autonomic failure, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, visual complaints and more.
The antibodies that attack the neural tissue develop in response to tumor cells.
The neoplasm may or may not be detectable using conventional imaging modalities.
Since PNS can be associated with multiple antibodies testing usually includes a panel of PNS antibodies.
In addition, the different PNS antibodies are associated with certain cancers so the antibody pattern can assist in identifying the specific tumor if it was previously undiagnosed.
Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is an enzyme that leads to the creation of the major neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA).
The initial discovery of GAD antibodies was found in a patient with stiff-person syndrome.
Later, GAD antibodies were identified in many patients with type 1 diabetes.
Patients with chronic cerebellar ataxia, drug-resistant epilepsy and myoclonus have also been found to have GAD antibodies.
GAD has two isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67, which are highly homologous but found in distinct subsets of patients.
GAD65 antibodies are specific to patients with insulin-dependent diabetes.
GAD67 is important to the maturation of perisomatic innervation.
The presence of GAD antibodies in a patient recently diagnosed with diabetes indicates a high risk of requiring insulin within three years.

CLL that is positive for the marker ZAP-70 has an average survival of 8 years.
CLL that is negative for ZAP-70 has an average survival of more than 25 years.
Many patients, especially older ones, with slowly progressing disease can be reassured and may not need any treatment in their lifetimes.
In systemic lupus erythematosis, the Zap-70 receptor pathway is missing and Syk takes its place.
ZAP70 deficiency results in a form of immune deficiency.
Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world, and was one of the first domesticated animals.
Chicken is a major world wide source of meat and eggs for human consumption.
Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat than most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) "strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with use of the drug in poultry production.
According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings.
Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.
Brome grass is a grass species producing pollen, which may induce hayfever, asthma and conjunctivitis in sensitised individuals.
Maple sugar is what remains after the sap of the sugar maple is boiled for longer than is needed to create maple syrup or maple taffy.
Once almost all the water has been boiled off, all that is left is a solid sugar.
By composition, this sugar is about 90% sucrose, the remainder consisting of variable amounts of glucose and fructose.
This is usually sold in pressed blocks or as a translucent candy.
It is difficult to create as the sugar easily burns and thus requires considerable skill.
It was the preferred form of First Nations/Native American peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time.
It was once called 'sinzibukwud'.
It is today used to flavor some maple products and can be used as an alternative to cane sugar.
Maple sugar is about twice as sweet as standard granulated sugar.
Estrone (C 18 H 22 O 2), an estrogenic hormone secreted by the ovary, has a melting point of 254.5 degrees Celsius.
It is one of three estrogens which also include estriol and estradiol.
Estrone is the least prevalent of the three hormones, estradiol being often more prevalent in normal females whereas estriol is prevalent primarily during pregnancy.
Estrone sulfate is important in health and disease beause of its conversion to estrone sulfate, a long-lived derivative of estrone.
Estrone sulfate acts as a pool of estrone which can be converted as needed to the more active estradiol.
Estrone is synthesized from androstenedione, a derivative of progesterone.
The conversion consists of the de-methylation of C-19 and the aromaticity of the 'A' ring.
This reaction is similar to the conversion of testosterone to estradiol.
PCSK9 encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme which binds to several different LDL, VLDL and apolipoprotein receptors and promotes their degradation.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with a rare form of autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (HCHOLA3).
Mutations in PCSK9 result in increased enzyme activity, which leads to increased receptor degradation and decreased availability of receptors to bind and transport lipids into the cell.
The end result is an increase in circulating lipid levels.

Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is a rare epileptic disorder that causes frequent violent seizures during sleep.
These seizures often involve complex motor movements, such as hand clenching, arm raising/lowering, and knee bending.
Vocalizations such as shouting, moaning, or crying are also common.
ADNFLE is often misdiagnosed as nightmares.
Attacks often occur in clusters and typically first manifest in childhood.
There are four known loci for ADNFLE, three with known causative genes.
These genes encode various nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Î± and Î² subunits CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2.
Paroxsmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a condition that causes hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure, and a proclivity to develop thrombosis.
PNH occurs when the PIG-A gene of bone marrow stem cells undergoes mutation.
Stems cells develop into erythrocytes (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, and mature cells that contain the PIG-A gene mutation, and as a result, lack a sufficient number of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP).
The GPI-APs have various roles, some of which are to help to prevent RBC destruction, fight infection, and promote thrombosis.
CD14, 16, 24, and 59 are GPI-linked proteins that are used as markers for the presence of GPI, as is fluorescent aerolysin (FLAER), which binds to GPI-APs.
Patients with PNH lack sufficient GPIs and therefore have reduced expression of these cell markers and FLAER compared to patients without PNH.
Patients with complete loss of CD59 are more likely to have hemolysis compared to patients with partial loss of CD59.
Biopterin is a coenzyme that is produced within the body.
It is an oxidized degradation product of tetrahydrobiopterin.

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a coronavirus found only in pigs.
It has a single antigenic type and can be grown in a number of different porcine cultures.
PHEV is ubiquitous and occurs in North and South America, Australia, and Asia.
PHEV is found in most breeding herds of swine, where infection is typically asymptomatic and a herd immunity exists.
PHEV spreads in secretions and multiplies in the nasal mucosa, tonsils, lungs, and to a lesser extent, the small intestine.
PHEV enters nuclei of the medulla oblongata and then moves to the peripheral nervous system where it spreads to the brain and brain stem.
Vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) leads to dehydration, cyanosis, coma and death.
Both wasting and vomiting are seen primarily in pigs less than 4 weeks old.
The encephalomyelitic form of PHEV infection starts with vomiting which is not severe, then moves to muscle tremors and hyperesthesia.
Those symptoms are followed by blindness, opisthotonos, and nystagmus.
Finally, the disease culminates into dyspnea, coma and death.
Both forms of disease have mortality rates close to 100% in piglets under 4 weeks of age.
Diagnosis of PHEV can be made when the virus is isolated from the brain or brain stem of euthanized pigs within 2 days of the onset of symptoms.
Assays to detect viral antigens and nucleic acids have recently been developed.
There is no treatment available.
It is advised to maintain the virus on the farm in order to preserve a natural immunity in the sows and to avoid outbreaks in the piglets.
No known infections of humans have been reported, but a potential for infection of humans with PHEV poses a potential threat.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 (cluster of differentiation 246) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALK gene.
The ALK gene can be oncogenic in two ways - first, by forming a fusion gene with any of several other genes, and second, with mutations of the actual DNA code for the gene itself.
The 2;5 chromosomal translocation is associated with approximately 60% anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs).
The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene and the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene: the 3' half of ALK, derived from chromosome 2, is fused to the 5' portion of NPM from chromosome 5.
The product of the NPM-ALK fusion gene is oncogenic.
The EML4-ALK fusion gene is responsible for approximately 3-5% of non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC).
The vast majority of cases are adenocarcinomas.
The standard test used to detect this gene in tumor samples is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), but other techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) can also be used to detect lung cancers with an ALK gene fusion.
ALK lung cancers are found in patients of all ages, although on average these patients may be somewhat younger.
ALK lung cancers are more common in never or light cigarette smokers, but a significant number of patients with this disease are current or former cigarette smokers.

Histidine is one of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids.
The imidazole side chains and the relatively neutral pK of histidine (ca 6.0) mean that relatively small shifts in cellular pH will change its charge.
For this reason, this amino acid side chain is used as a co-ordinating ligand in metalloproteins, and as a catalytic site in certain enzymes.
The imidazole side chain has two nitrogens with different properties: One is bound to hydrogen and donates its lone pair to the aromatic ring and as such is slighty acidic, whereas the other one donates only one electron to the ring so it has a free lone pair and is basic.
Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a species of gram-positive, coccoid, beta-hemolytic bacteria.

C. difficile is an opportunistic anaerobic bacterium that grows in the intestine when the normal flora has been altered by antibiotic treatment.
Patients develop gastrointestinal problems ranging from mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis.
Many cases of the milder forms of gastrointestinal illness and most cases of pseuomembranous colitis are caused by toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile.
Toxigenic strains of the organisim carry the genes encoding the toxins while non-toxigenic strains do not carry the toxin genes.
The diseases result from the toxins that the toxigenic organism produces.
The clinical symptoms associated with the disease are primarily due to Toxin A, which is a tissue-damaging enterotoxin.
A second toxin, Toxin B, referred to as the cytotoxin of the organism, is also produced; this is the toxin detected by the tissue culture assay currently used by many laboratories.
C. difficile strains produce both toxins or only Toxin B.
The glutamate dehydrogenase of C. difficile is a good antigen marker for the organism in feces because it is produced in high amounts by all strains, toxigenic or non-toxigenic.
A positive result confirms the presence of this organism in a fecal specimen; a negative result indicates absence of the organism.

Ojo-Amaize, EA Lymphocyte Mitogen Stimulation.
Lymphocyte mitogen stimulation assays are used for in vitro assessment of cellular immunity in patients with immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, cancer and chemical-induced hypersensitivity reactions.
Lymphocytes from healthy human subjects have receptors for mitogens such as the plant lectin concanavalin A (UCon A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), the protein A component of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SpA) and chemicals.
Lymphocytes respond to these mitogens (substances that stimulate large numbers of lymphocytes without prior sensitization and in contrast to antigens do not require a sensitized host).
Both B cells and T cells can be stimulated with mitogens.
Inability of lymphocytes to respond to mitogens is a sign of impaired cell-mediated or humoral immunity.
There is a good correlation between CD4+ T-cell subset numbers and mitogenic response to PWM at different disease states in patients with HIV infection.

Mixing studies are tests performed on blood plasma used to distinguish factor deficiencies from factor inhibitors, such as lupus anticoagulants, or specific factor inhibitors, such as antibodies directed against factor VIII).
If the result obtained with the immediate normal plasma mixture corrects to within the reference range, a factor deficiency or specific factor inhibitor is suspected.
No correction after addition of normal plasma suggests an immediately acting nonspecific inhibitor such as lupus anticoagulant (or heparin).
After incubation, an aPTT result equivalent to that of the original mixture is indicative of a factor deficiency, whereas initial correction, but prolongation after incubation suggests a time-dependent inhibitor such as a specific factor VIII inhibitor.
Mixing studies sometimes need to be interpreted in the context of specific reagents used (such as lupus-sensitive reagents).

Base excess refers to the amount of a strong acid required to bring back the blood pH to the normal value of 7.4.
The term and concept were first introduced by Astrup and Siggaard-Andersen in 1958 as a way to measure the metabolic component of an acid-base disturbance.
Actual versus standard: In vivo, acid-base homeostasis takes place throughout the extracellular fluid (ECF), not just the blood compartment that is in a patient specimen.
The concept of "standard" base excess attempts to adjust for the base excess of the entire extracellular compartment by calculating the base excess for blood diluted as if the entire extracellular compartment were sampled (approx Hgb of 5g/l).
So the ACTUAL base excess (ABE) is the dose of acid to return PLASMA to normal pH, whereas the STANDARD base excess (SBE) is the dose to return ECF to normal pH. Adjusting for oxygen saturation: Base excess normally assumes 100% oxygen saturation, which is valid for many arterial specimens.
However, it is possible to add additional terms to the calculation which account for the actual oxygen saturation of the patient sample.
The terms in LOINC indicating 'Base excess.100% oxygenated' are intended to encode base excess terms adjusted for oxygen saturation (i.e. do not assume 100% oxygenation).

The group of drugs called cannabinoids includes both the cannabinoid chemicals found in the cannabis plant as well as synthetic and pharmaceutical cannabinoids.
The cannabinoids in cannabis include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol (CBN).
THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and binds to the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors.
CBD does not have psychoactive effects but rather has a variety of therapeutic properties including anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-anxiety, and antiemetic.
The THC to CBD ratio determines the physiologic effects of the drug.
A high THC/CBD ratio results in euphoric and anxiolytic effects, while a low THC/CBD ratio results in sedative effects.
Both natural and synthetic cannabinoid compounds are used for therapeutic purposes.
Synthetic cannabinoids, like THC, act on the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
Adverse reactions, including psychosis, confusion, agitation, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, seizures, and fatal overdoses, are more common with synthetic cannabinoids compared to cannabis.
CD11c, also known as Integrin, alpha X (complement component 3 receptor 4 subunit) (ITGAX), is a human gene.
This gene encodes the integrin alpha X chain protein.
Integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain.
This protein combines with the beta 2 chain (ITGB2) to form a leukocyte-specific integrin referred to as inactivated-C3b (iC3b) receptor 4 (CR4).
The alpha X beta 2 complex seems to overlap the properties of the alpha M beta 2 integrin in the adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to stimulated endothelium cells, and in the phagocytosis of complement coated particles.
CD11c is a type I transmembrane protein found at high levels on most human dendritic cells, but also on monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and some B cells that induces cellular activation and helps trigger neutrophil respiratory burst; expressed in hairy cell leukemias, acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, and some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias.

An abnormal or compensatory head posture occurs when the head is deviated out of the normal primary straight head position in order to minimize symptoms due to an ocular or non-ocular problem.
Abnormal head positions can include chin up or down, head tilt to the right or left, face turns to the right or left, or a combination of any of these.
Ocular causes of abnormal head posture include: 1) eye misalignment or strabismus, in which the patient finds the head position that will best align vision and/or relieve eye strain; 2) nystagmus, in which different head positions may slow down nystagmus and allow better vision; 3) ptosis, in which the chin is typically elevated to help the eye or eyes see "beneath" the droopy eyelid, and 4) refractive errors, in which turning the head to one side may allow the patient to see better since they are looking through the narrowed opening of the eyelids, which simulates a "squinting" mechanism.
The Bartlett score measures the quality of sputum specimens for microbiology testing.
The score is derived from a microscopic exam of sputum specimens that looks at; 1) the number of neutrophils per low power field, 2) the presence of mucus strands, and 3) the number of squamous epithelial cells per low power field.
Segmented neutrophils and mucus strands may be indicative of inflammation, thus a high quality sputum specimens.
High numbers of epithelial cells are not indicative of inflammation and might indicate contamination with saliva.
A score of 1,2, or 3 indicates active inflammation.
A score of 0 or less indicates a lack of inflammation or contamination with saliva.
<10 score = 0; 10-25 score = +1; >25 score = +2; Mucus present score = +1 Epithelial cells/LPF: 10-25 score = -1; >25 score = -2
Chromosome region Yp11.3 contains the SRY gene, which codes for the sex-determining region Y protein.
The SRY protein is a transcription factor that initiates male sexual development.
Translocation of the SRY gene to the X chromosome causes 46, XX males.
The fetus carrying the SRY gene on an X chromosome will develop male characteristics despite not having a Y chromosome.
Deletion or mutations in the SRY gene leads to 46, XY females with either normal female external genitalia or ambiguous genitalia.
Patient's with Turner syndrome (45, X) may also be tested to determine if Y chromosome material, including the SRY gene, is present.

Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine.
It is sold under the brand names Norpramin Â® and Pertofrane Â®.
It is used to treat depression, but not considered a first line treatment since the introduction of SSRI antidepressants.
Desipramine is an active metabolite of imipramine.
Along with other tricyclics, desipramine has found use in treating neuropathic pain.
The mechanism of action seems to involve the activation, through norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, of descending pathways in the spinal cord that block pain signals from ascending to the brain.
Desipramine is one of the most potent and selective medications in this respect.
Some evidence suggests that desipramine may help with ADD.

They are a major component of the cell's cytoskeleton, and provide support for normal axonal radial growth (i.e. increases in axon's diameter).
Neurofilament, NF, immunostaining is common in diagnostic neuropathology.
It is useful for differentiating neurons (positive for NF) from glia (negative for NF).
Tau proteins are proteins that stabilize microtubules.
They are abundant in neurons of the central nervous system and are less common elsewhere, but are also expressed at very low levels in CNS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
When tau proteins are defective, and no longer stabilize microtubules properly, they can result in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease.
Tau proteins interact with tubulin to stabilize microtubules and promote tubulin assembly into microtubules.
Tau has two ways of controlling microtubule stability: isoforms and phosphorylation.
Six tau isoforms exist in brain tissue, and they are distinguished by their number of binding domains.
Three isoforms have three binding domains and the other three have four binding domains.
The binding domains are located in the carboxy-terminus of the protein and are positively-charged (allowing it to bind to the negatively-charged microtubule).
The isoforms with four binding domains are better at stabilizing microtubules than those with three binding domains.
The isoforms are a result of alternative splicing in exons 2,3, and 10 of the tau gene.
Phosphorylation of tau is regulated by a host of kinases.
For example, PKN, a serine/threonine kinase.
When PKN is activated, it phosphorylates tau, resulting in disruption of microtubule organization Taniguchi et al., 2001.
False ragweed grows almost over all the continental United States.
Related species are found in Mexico, Hawaii and Australia.
False ragweed is considered to be a major source of pollen allergy in certain areas of the USA where the plant is common.
Asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, similar to sensitisation from other Ragweeds, occur in sensitised individuals.
Symptoms may be elicited either due to sensitisation to this species, or due to cross-reactive mechanisms with other members of the Ragweed genus.

The Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified as the cause of a respiratory illness outbreak, later defined as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), in Wuhan, China.
The full genome of the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 was first posted by Chinese health authorities in GenBank, the NIH genetic sequence database, and in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAI) portal.
This facilitated detection of the virus globally with subsequent sequences being nearly identical, suggesting a single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus.
Real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) tests targeting regions within genes, including RdRp, S, N, M, and E genes, specific to SARS-CoV-2 have been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and others for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
Some assays only detect SARS-CoV-2 and other assays detect other strains (e.g. SARS-CoV) that are genetically similar.

The system was validated and refined through an interRAI / Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care collaboration.
Three main goals guided its development: 1) to support decision making; 2) to record basic clinical information on persons who would not be receiving any additional comprehensive assessment at a later stage; and 3) to provide initial clinical information for end-of-life and long-term persons (maintenance, supportive, and long-stay rehabilitation) in order that short-term services, if necessary, could be put in place prior to completion of the full interRAI HC or interRAI PC Assessment.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are Staphylococci that are unable to produce coagulase, an enzyme that causes blood clot formation.
CoNS species include S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, and S. caprae.
S. epidermidis is a commensal of the skin, but can cause severe infections in immune-suppressed patients and those with central venous catheters.
S. saprophyticus, another coagulase-negative species that is part of the normal vaginal flora, is predominantly found in genitourinary tract infections in sexually-active young women.
In recent years, several other Staphylococcus species have been implicated in human infections, notably S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, and S. caprae.

Implicit a-wave time is the amount of time between the flash onset and the trough of the retinal a-wave produced on an electroretinogram (ERG).
Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, also known as cyclooxygenase-2 or simply COX-2, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PTGS2 gene.
Cyclooxygenase-2 is unexpressed under normal conditions in most cells, but elevated levels are found during inflammation.
Since COX-2 is generally expressed only in cells where prostaglandins are upregulated (e.g., during inflammation), drug-candidates that selectively inhibit COX-2 are thought to show fewer side-effects.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit prostaglandin production by cyclooxygenases (COX) 1 and 2. NSAIDs selective for inhibition of COX-2 are less likely than traditional drugs to cause gastrointenstinal adverse effects, but could cause cardiovascular events, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
Studies with human pharmacology and genetics, genetically manipulated rodents, and other animal models and randomized trials indicate that this is due to suppression of COX-2-dependent cardioprotective prostaglandins, prostacyclin in particular NSAID (non-specific inhibitor of COX-2)
Flurbiprofen (green) bound to COX-2.
Flurbiprofen is stabilized via hydrophobic interactions and polar interactions (Tyr-355 and Arg-120).
The expression of COX-2 is upregulated in many cancers.
The overexpression of COX-2 along with increased angiogenesis and GLUT-1 expression is significantly associated with gallbladder carcinomas.
Furthermore the product of COX-2, PGH2 is converted by prostaglandin E2 synthase into PGE2, which in turn can stimulate cancer progression.
Consequently inhibiting COX-2 may have benefit in the prevention and treatment of these types of cancer.

Integrin, beta 2 (complement component 3 receptor 3 and 4 subunit), also known as CD18 or ITGB2, is a human gene.
CD18 is the beta subunit of three different structures: LFA-1 (paired with CD11a), Macrophage-1 antigen (paired with CD11b), Integrin alphaXbeta2 (paired with CD11c), and Integrin alphaXbeta2 (paired with CD11c).
The ITGB2 protein product is the integrin beta chain beta 2.
Integrins are integral cell-surface proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain.
A given chain may combine with multiple partners resulting in different integrins.
For example, beta 2 combines with the alpha L chain to form the integrin LFA-1, and combines with the alpha M chain to form the integrin Mac-1.
Integrins are known to participate in cell adhesion as well as cell-surface mediated signalling.
Brewer's yeast (also known as brewing yeast) can mean any live yeast used in brewing.
It can also mean yeast obtained as a by-product of brewing, dried and killed, and used as a dietary supplement for its B vitamin content.
Brewers classify yeasts as top-fermenting and bottom-fermenting.
This distinction was introduced by the Dane Emil Christian Hansen.
"Top-fermenting yeasts" are so called because they form a foam at the top of the wort during fermentation.
They can produce higher alcohol concentrations and prefer higher temperatures, typically 16 to 24 Â°C (61 to 75 Â°F), producing fruitier, sweeter, ale-type beers.
An example of a top-fermenting yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known to brewers as ale yeast.
"Bottom-fermenting yeasts" are typically used to produce lager-type beers, though can also produce ale-type beers.
These yeasts ferment more sugars, leaving a crisper taste, and grow well at low temperatures.
An example of bottom fermenting yeast is Saccharomyces pastorianus, formerly known as Saccharomyces carlsbergensis.

It is primarily assessed through Doppler echocardiography though more invasive cardiac catherization and provides a means of calculating the approximate mitral valve area and evaluating mitral valve stenosis regurgitation.
Caution should be used when applying pressure half-time measurements in patients with prosthetic mitral valves, mitral commissurotomy, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and aortic insufficiency.
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate as serum is cooled below core body temperatures.
Cryoglobulinemia is characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the serum.
Single-component cryoglobulins contain only one isotype of immunoglobulin or, in rare instances, a cryoprecipitable monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain.
Mixed cryoglobulins are immune complexes made of two different types of immunoglobulin, usually an IgM antiglobulin and IgG antigen.
The classification initially proposed (Brouet et al) describes simple cryoglobulins as type I, and sub-divides mixed cryoglobulins as type II, in which case the antiglobulin is typically monoclonal, and type III, in which the antiglobulin is polyclonal.
Some disorders associated with Type I are: multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and other lymphoproliferative diseases.
Type II may be associated with: chronic hepatitis C virus infection, Sjogren's syndrome, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins' lymphoma, autoimmune diseases.
Type III may be associated with: chronic infections, viral (EBV, CMV, HIV, hepatitis viruses), bacterial (SBE, leprosy, spirochetal), fungal, parasitic, autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and biliary cirrhosis.
Screening for complement levels is done by quantitating antigenic levels of C3 and C4 and determining total hemolytic complement (CH50).
Very low or undetectable levels of C4 with normal or relatively normal levels of C3 are often seen in type II cryoglobulinemia, and may suggest this diagnosis or a need for further workup for HCV infection.
Low complement levels may also be seen in association with type II cryoglobulinemia complicating Sjogren's syndrome or with type III cryoglobulinemia in patients with rheumatoid vasculitis or SLE.

The zona-free hamster egg-human sperm penetration assay is a test used to evaluate the ability of the sperm to penetrate an egg.
It is also an indicator of the number of sperm required for fertilization in the in vitro fertilization procedure.
Techniques are utilized to enhance penetration if the value is low.
Hamsters are injected with hormones to produce many eggs; the eggs are collected and the outer egg membrane dissolved with chemicals.
After the sperm sample has been prepared with special techniques, it is added to approximately 30-50 eggs.
Many hours later the eggs are examined for penetration by the sperm.
The human sperm does not fertilize the hamster eggs.

Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic fungus that affects many plant species, although its most notable hosts may be wine grapes.
In viticulture, it is commonly known as botrytis bunch rot; in horticulture, it is usually called grey mould or gray mold.
The fungus gives rise to two different kinds of infections on grapes.
The first, grey rot, is the result of consistently wet or humid conditions, and typically results in the loss of the affected bunches.
The second, noble rot, occurs when drier conditions follow wetter, and can result in distinctive sweet dessert wines, such as Sauternes or the AszÃº of Tokaj.
The species name Botrytis cinerea is derived from the Latin for "grapes like ashes"; although poetic, the "grapes" refers to the bunching of the fungal spores on their conidiophores, and "ashes" just refers to the greyish color of the spores en masse.
The fungus is usually referred to by its anamorph (asexual form) name, because the sexual phase is rarely observed.
The teleomorph (sexual form) is an ascomycete, Botryotinia cinerea (see taxonomy box).

HMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas, and stands for Human Melanoma Black.
It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors.
The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma.
It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity.
The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.
HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).
Myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) is a 100 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein found in the periaxonal membranes of Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes of myelin sheaths.
Despite the fact that MAG is a known white matter inhibitor of axonal regeneration and as a receptor for IgM antibodies that demyelinates peripheral nerves, it has important roles that promote normal formation and maintenance of myelinated axons.
There are two apparent functions of MAG which are to act as a ligand for an axonal receptor which maintains myelinated axons, and to act as an axonal signal receptor that promotes differentiation, maintenance, and survival of oligodendrocytes.
MAG shares an epitope with other glyoconjugates that is the target protein in autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, that is associated with IgM gammopathy which causes the death of oligodendrocytes that is seen in multiple sclerosis.

A spermatozoon or spermatozoan (pl. spermatozoa), from the ancient Greek (seed) and (living being) is the haploid cell that is the male gamete.
After a female ovum is fertilized by a sperm cell it becomes a zygote.
Sperm cells contribute half of the genetic information to the diploid offspring and the other hallf is contributed by the female ovum.
In mammals, the sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm cells: a spermatozoon bearing a Y chromosome will lead to a male (XY) offspring, whereas one bearing an X chromosome will lead to a female (XX) offspring (the ovum always provides an X chromosome).
Sperm cells were first observed by a student of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek in 1677.

Serum cryoglobulins are typically immunoglobulins that, in vitro, precipitate at temperatures below 37Â°C and redissolve on rewarming.
Cryoglobulins can be transient and without clinical implications or they can be a marker of significant disease.
Monoclonal cryoglobulins, which include IgG, IgM, or IgA, or monoclonal free light chains, are usually associated with haematological disorders.
Mixed cryoglobulins, which contain polyclonal immunoglobulins with or without a monoclonal component, are found in many infectious and systemic disorders.
There is a significant association between essential mixed cryoglobulinaemia and hepatitis C virus infection (> 90%).
Cryoglobulins may also contain complement components, such as C3, C4 and C1q.

Lecithin naturally occurs in plants and animals.
It is composed of glycerol, two fatty acids, a phosphate group, and choline.
Lecithin is found in many foods including egg yolks, liver, peanuts, corn, spinach, whole grains, and soy beans.
Lecithin is used commercially as an emulsifier in baking mixes, candy, chewing gum, chocolate, ice cream, macaroni, margarine, whipped toppings, and many more.
Lecithin in the body is present in bile and functions to help emulsify dietary fats in the lumen of the small intestine.
Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder.
Lecithin is a the most abundant phospholipid that makes up the majority of cellular membranes.
Lecithin mixes with oil and water to form micelles.
Micelles are spherical shells of fat surounded by lecithin.
The nonpolar tails are oriented inward toward the fat and the polar end of lecithin is oriented outward toward the water.
The formation of micelles is a mechanical process known as emulsification which breaks fat into small droplets and makes the droplets water soluble.
Iodine is a trace element that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement.
Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).
Thyroid hormones regulate many important biochemical reactions, including protein synthesis and enzymatic activity, and are critical determinants of metabolic activity.
They are also required for proper skeletal and central nervous system development in fetuses and infants.
Thyroid function is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also known as thyrotropin.
It is secreted by the pituitary gland to control thyroid hormone production and secretion, thereby protecting the body from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
TSH secretion increases thyroidal uptake of iodine and stimulates the synthesis and release of T3 and T4.
In the absence of sufficient iodine, TSH levels remain elevated, leading to goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland that reflects the body's attempt to trap more iodine from the circulation and produce thyroid hormones.
Iodine may have other physiological functions in the body as well.
For example, it appears to play a role in immune response and might have a beneficial effect on mammary dysplasia and fibrocystic breast disease.
Glucopsychosine (also called glucosylsphingosine) is a biomarker for selective deficiency of the enzyme, beta-glucocerebrosidase (beta-glucosidase), the cause of the autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease.

The corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test is used to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and help diagnose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH or corticotropin) dependent Cushing's disease.
CRH stimulation cannot distinguish between Cushing's and pseudo-Cushing's.
During the procedure, baseline ACTH measurements are followed by administration of 1 ug/kg of CRH, after which ACTH is measured again at timed intervals.
In patients with Cushing's, ACTH concentrations at 15 and 30 minutes post CRH administration should be at least 35% higher than the mean baseline value.
Patients with ectopic ACTH secretion will not have the same increase between pre- and post-.
The timing for baseline and post-CRH ACTH measurements vary depending on local protocol.

Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungus causing allergic and invasive aspergillosis in humans and animals.
It is unusual compared to other allergen sources in that it is both a primary and an opportunistic pathogen, as well as an important major allergen.
Its conidia production is prolific, so humans are continually inhaling its ubiquitous spores.
The result is that exposure of the respiratory tract is almost constant.
However, inhalation rarely causes adverse effects, as the conidia are usually eliminated efficiently by the innate immune system.
But increasing use of immunosuppressive therapy has resulted in increasingly frequent conditions involving infection by A fumigatus.
Tin is a component of many soils and may be released in dusts from wind storms, roads, and farming activities.
Gases, dusts, and fumes containing tin may be released from smelting and refining processes, burning of waste, and burning of fossil fuels (coal or oil).
In small amounts tin does not cause any harmful effects, however, ingesting large amounts of inorganic tin may cause abdominal pain, anemia, and liver and kidney problems.
There is no evidence that inorganic tin compounds affect reproductive functions, produce birth defects, or cause cancer.
Fetal red cells contain fetal hemoglobin (also hemoglobin F, HbF, or Î±2Î³2) that is the main oxygen transport protein in the human fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and persists in the newborn until roughly 6 months old.
Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.
In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult hemoglobin by approximately 6 months postnatally, except in a few thalassemia cases.

Reserpine is an indole alkaloid antipsychotic and antihypertensive drug that has been used for the control of high blood pressure and for the relief of psychotic symptoms, although because of the development of better drugs for these purposes and because of its numerous side-effects, it is rarely used today.
The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among the others) from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings.
These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral resistance.
Reserpine depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapses is often cited as evidence to the theory that depletion of the neurotransmitters causes subsequent depression in humans.
Moreover, reserpine has a peripheral action in many parts of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the cholinergic part of the nervous system (GI tract, smooth muscles vessels).

One molecule of ATP contains three phosphate groups, and it is produced by ATP synthase from inorganic phosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate (AMP).
Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it back into its precursors.
ATP is therefore continuously recycled in organisms: the human body, which on average contains only 250 grams (8.8 oz) of ATP, turns over its own body weight in ATP each day.
ATP is used as a substrate in signal transduction pathways by kinases that phosphorylate proteins and lipids, as well as by adenylate cyclase, which uses ATP to produce the second messenger molecule cyclic AMP.
Presently (2012), HIV-1 strains are divided into four groups, including group M (major) with subtypes A through K, group O (outlier), group N (non-M or O), and group P. HIV-2 is divided into subtypes A through E. Occasionally, two viruses of different subtypes can "cross react" and blend their genetic material to create a new hybrid HIV virus.
However, many of these new strains do not survive for long.
Studies have also shown that the core proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 display frequent cross-reactivity whereas the envelope proteins are more type-specific.

A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant (the pit inside the red or purple fruit).
The fruits, coffee cherries or coffee berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together.
In a crop of coffee, a small percentage of cherries contain a single bean, instead of the usual two.
This is called a peaberry.
Coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm that contains 0.8 - 2.5 % caffeine, which is one of the main reasons the plants are cultivated.
As coffee is one of the world's most widely consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop, and an important export product for some countries.
It is considered a regularly consumed beverage in the United States - as popular as soft drinks and even water - and because of the volume consumed, it is here that coffee is highest in demand.
Myelin basic protein (MBP) is important in the process of myelination of nerves in the central nervous system (CNS).
MBP was initially sequenced in 1979 after isolation from myelin membranes.
Since that time, knockout mice deficient in MBP have been developed which showed decreased amounts of CNS myelination and a progressive disorder characterized by tremors, seizures, and early death.
The gene for MBP is on chromosome 18; the protein localizes to the CNS and to various cells of the hematopoietic system.
The pool of MBP in the central nervous system is very diverse, with several splice variants being expressed and a large number of post-translational modifications on the protein, which include phosphorylation, methylation, deamidation and citrullination.
Interest in MBP has centered on its role in demyelinating diseases, particularly multiple sclerosis (MS).

A Hepatic Iron Index (HII) is not calculated for patients less than 14 years.
An HII less than 1.0 is consistent with normal iron accumulation.
An HII 1.0 through 1.9 is consistent with mild iron accumulation such as in heterozygous hemochromatosis or alchoholic liver disease.
An HII greater than 1.9 is consistent with iron overload such as in homozygous hemochromatosis, multiple transfusions, porphyria cutanea tarda, and cirrhotic liver disease.
The HII will decrease with chronic blood loss or phlebotomy.
The Guinea Pig (unrelated to Pigs-the name may be due to this rodent's shrill squeal), native to South America, has been used as a domesticated food source for hundreds of years in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.
Guinea Pigs have also been invaluable in research laboratories, where they have been used in fields such as nutrition, pathology, genetics, and toxicology.
The Guinea Pig is also an excellent pet, much handled by children due to its gentleness and sociability.
Cavia porcellus are not known in the wild (unless in a feral state), but domesticated Guinea Pigs are now found worldwide in captivity.
Asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis occurs frequently following sensitisation to Guinea Pig allergen.
Argininemia, also called arginase deficiency, is an autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder where a deficiency of the enzyme arginase causes a build up of arginine and ammonia in the blood.
Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if levels become too high.
The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia.
Elevated level of Dicarboxyoleylcarnitine (C18:1-DC) is a marker for Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT11), and very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiencies.
Power is defined as the rate at which energy is transfered from one place to another or transformed from one form to another.
Power is expressed in the SI unit watt (W), named in honor of the Scottish engineer James Watt.
A Watt is equivalent to one joule (J) per second (s), W=J/s.
The commonly used measure of engine power, the horsepower, is approximately 746 W.
The highest level of education attained.
Glucagon, a peptide hormone secreted by the pancreas, raises blood glucose levels.
Its effect is opposite that of insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels.
The pancreas releases glucagon when blood sugar (glucose) levels fall too low.
Glucagon causes the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream.
High blood glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin.
Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues.
Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels at a stable level.
Glucagon belongs to a family of several other related hormones.
Abnormally-elevated levels of glucagon may be caused by pancreatic tumors, such as glucagonoma, symptoms of which include necrolytic migratory erythema, reduced amino acids, and hyperglycemia.
It may occur alone or in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
One of the CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS that is sometimes effective against absence seizures.
It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle.
However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance.
Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition.
(From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)
Poppy is an annual herb native to south-eastern Europe and western Asia.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme produced primarily in the liver but are also found in the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas and kidney cells.
The main function of ALT is to convert alanine into pyruvate.
ALT is released into the bloodstream when cells containing it are damaged.
Increased levels of ALT in the blood provide an early indicator of liver damage.
ALT is often measured with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as part of a liver panel.
High levels of ALT could indicate hepatitis, obstructed bile ducts, liver tumors, cirrhosis, alcoholism or other liver disorders.
The GAA gene is located on chromosome 17q25.3 and encodes acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of glycogen.

Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in foods, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids).
Calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling and hormonal secretion, though less than 1% of total body calcium is needed to support these metabolic functions.
Serum calcium is very tightly regulated and does not fluctuate with changes in dietary intakes; the body uses bone tissue as a reservoir for, and source of calcium, to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in blood, muscle, and intercellular fluids.
The remaining 99% of the body's calcium supply is stored in the bones and teeth where it supports their structure and function.
Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich sources of calcium.
Nondairy sources include vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli.
The SMN2 gene (survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric) is located on chromosome 5q13.2.
This gene is part of a 500 kb inverted duplication on chromosome 5q13.
This duplicated region contains at least four genes and repetitive elements which make it prone to rearrangements and deletions.
The repetitiveness and complexity of the sequence have also caused difficulty in determining the organization of this genomic region.
The telomeric and centromeric copies of this gene are nearly identical and encode the same protein.
While mutations in the telomeric copy are associated with spinal muscular atrophy, mutations in this gene, the centromeric copy, do not lead to disease.
This gene may be a modifier of disease caused by mutation in the telomeric copy.
The critical sequence difference between the two genes is a single nucleotide in exon 7, which is thought to be an exon splice enhancer.
Note that the nine exons of both the telomeric and centromeric copies are designated historically as exon 1, 2a, 2b, and 3-8.
It is thought that gene conversion events may involve the two genes, leading to varying copy numbers of each gene.
The full length protein encoded by this gene localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Within the nucleus, the protein localizes to subnuclear bodies called gems which are found near coiled bodies containing high concentrations of small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).
This protein forms heteromeric complexes with proteins such as SIP1 and GEMIN4, and also interacts with several proteins known to be involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs, such as hnRNP U protein and the small nucleolar RNA binding protein.
Four transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

The respiratory disease caused by BHV-1 is commonly known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis.
Symptoms include fever, discharge from the nose, cough, difficulty breathing, and loss of appetite.
Ulcers commonly occur in the mouth and nose.
Mortality may reach 10 percent.
The genital disease causes infectious pustular vulvovaginitis in cows and infectious balanoposthitis in bulls.
In biochemistry and nutrition, monounsaturated fats are fatty acids that have a single double bond in the fatty acid chain and all of the remainder of the carbon atoms in the chain are single-bonded.
By contrast, polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one double bond.
Fatty acids are long-chained molecules having a methyl group at one end and a carboxylic acid group at the other end.
Fatty acid fluidity increases with increasing number of double bonds.
Therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting temperature than polyunsaturated fatty acids but lower than saturated fatty acids.
Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated.

The DMD gene (dystrophin) is located on chromosome Xp21.2.
The dystrophin gene is the largest gene found in nature, measuring 2.4 Mb.
The gene was identified through a positional cloning approach, targeted at the isolation of the gene responsible for Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) Muscular Dystrophies.
DMD is a recessive, fatal, X-linked disorder occurring at a frequency of about 1 in 3,500 new-born males.
BMD is a milder allelic form.
In general, DMD patients carry mutations which cause premature translation termination (nonsense or frame shift mutations), while in BMD patients dystrophin is reduced either in molecular weight (derived from in-frame deletions) or in expression level.
The dystrophin gene is highly complex, containing at least eight independent, tissue-specific promoters and two polyA-addition sites.
Furthermore, dystrophin RNA is differentially spliced, producing a range of different transcripts, encoding a large set of protein isoforms.
Dystrophin (as encoded by the Dp427 transcripts) is a large, rod-like cytoskeletal protein which is found at the inner surface of muscle fibers.
Dystrophin is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which bridges the inner cytoskeleton (F-actin) and the extra-cellular matrix.
CD79 (Cluster of Differentiation 79) is a transmembrane protein that forms a complex with the B-cell receptor (BCR) and generates a signal following recognition of antigen by the BCR.
CD79 is composed of two distinct chains called CD79A and CD79B (formerly known as Ig-alpha and Ig-beta); these form a heterodimer on the surface of a B cell stabilized by disulfide bonding.
CD79a and CD79b are both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
Human CD79a is encoded by the mb-1 gene that is located on chromosome 19, and CD79b is encoded by the B29 gene that located on chromosome 17.
Both CD79 chains contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in their intracellular tails that they use to propagate a signal in a B cell, in a similar manner to CD3 generated signal tranduction observed during T cell receptor activation on T cells.
Vasoactive intestinal peptide also known as the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or VIP is a peptide hormone containing 29 amino acid residues that is produced in many tissues of vertebrates including the gut, pancreas and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus in the brain.

While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date.
These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode the same protein.
Hemosiderin or haemosiderin is an abnormal microscopic pigment found in the human body.
Hemosiderin is composed of iron oxide and can accumulate in different organs in various diseases.
Iron is required by many of the chemical reactions in the body but is toxic when not properly contained.
Thus, many methods of iron storage have developed.
Humans typically store iron within a protein called ferritin.
The form of iron in ferritin is iron(III) oxyhydroxide.
By complexing with ferritin, the iron is made water soluble.
Several diseases result in deposition of iron(III) oxyhydroxide in tissues in an insoluble form.
These deposits of iron are called hemosiderin.
Although these deposits often cause no symptoms, they can lead to organ damage.

It is used as an antifungal preservative in pharmaceutical preparations and foods.
It may also be used as a test for liver function.
Indole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound.
It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring.
Indole is a popular component of fragrances and the precursor to many pharmaceuticals.
Compounds that contain an indole ring are called indoles.
Notably, the indolic amino acid tryptophan is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
Nicomorphine (Vilan, Subellan, Gevilan, MorZet) is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of morphine.
It is a strong opioid agonist analgesic two to three times as potent as morphine with a side effect profile similar to that of dihydromorphine, morphine, and diamorphine.
The 3,6-diesters of morphine are drugs with more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration due to increased lipid solubility and other structural considerations.
The prototype for this subgroup of semi-synthetic opiates is heroin and the group also includes dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, disalicylmorphine and others.
Whilst this produces an enhanced "bang" when the drug is administered intravenously, it cannot be distinguished from morphine via other routes, although the different side effect profile, including lower incidence of nausea, is very apparent.
Bifidobacterium is a genus of Gram-positive, non-motile, often branched anaerobic bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract and vagina.
Bifidobacteria are one of the major genera of bacteria that make up the gut flora, the bacteria that reside in the colon.
Bifidobacteria aid in digestion, are associated with a lower incidence of allergies and also prevent some forms of tumor growth.
Some bifidobacteria are used as probiotics.
Equine influenza (Horse flu) is the disease caused by strains of Influenza A that are enzootic in horse species.
Equine influenza occurs globally, and is caused by two main strains of virus: equine-1 (H7N7) and equine-2 (H3N8).
The disease has a nearly 100% infection rate in an unvaccinated horse population with no prior exposure to the virus.
While equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans, the impact of an outbreak would have been devastating.
Since people heavily relied upon horses for communication (postal service), military (cavalry) and general transport, the social and economic impact of widespread equine disease would have been devastating.
However, in modern times the ramifications of equine influenza are most clear in the modern racing industry.
Measures circulating epithelial cells that are assumed to be carcinoma cells.
In the context of breast cancer, a count of greater than 5 circulating tumor calls per 7.5 mL predicts a significantly shorter survival than those with a less then 5.
Test is based on immunologic stain for Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) antigen which are manetically tagged to concentrate them, then stained with CD45+ Alophycocyan (CD45-APC), anti cytokeratin phycoerythrin 8, 18, and 19 (CK-PE) and PAPI to identify the nucleus.
The goal is to find epithelium derived cells.
EpCAM is not always present in tumor cells and it is not completely specific so CK-PE is needed to confirm epitelial, PAPI to verify that the object is a cell not depre and CD45 to detect and exclude white cells.
In terms of markers, the cells of interest are those that EpCAM+ CK-PE+ PAPI+ (to be sure that they are cells) and CD45-APC negative (to exclude white cells.
Counts from this manufacturer are reportes per 7.5ml.
At present only one product is approved by the FDA is ."CellSearchâ¢ system (Veridex), and it is offered by all of the major laboratories.
As of May 2011, It has only been approved for metastatic, breast, prostate and colorectal cancer.
The test has not specificity for a particular cancer, but the cut off for deciding worse prognosis differs by organ.
Other mechanisms for measuring Circulating Tumor cells, exist, most internally developed by laboratories and not fully automated.
Another company has an experimental system that does not depend upon magnetically tagged EpCAM for a first pass cut- claims to be able to count more cells (30 cc of blood), and may be more sensitive.
Lipoxygenase (LOX) is an enzyme that catalyzes polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid to form hyperperoxides through the eicosanoid pathway.
The derived hyperperoxides or eicosanoids are signaling lipids that regulate a group of homeostatic and inflammatory processes.
LOX is present in immune, epithelial, and tumor cells and can lead to inflammation, skin disorders, and tumorigenesis.
Patients who are sensitized to pollen can develop seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and have been found to have increased LOX in the nasal mucosa.
Butylone, is an illicit designer drug and substance of abuse, also known as Î²-keto-N-methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine and (bk-MBDB).
One of the drugs in a family of synthetic cathinones (street name 'bath salts'), it is an entactogen, psychedelic, and stimulant of the phenethylamine chemical class, and the Î²-keto analogue of MBDB.
The effects of butylone have not been described in any scientific literature, however, some drug forums report personal experiences with butylone that are similar to methylone and ethylone: euphoria, stimulation, mental sharpness and a warm safe feeling.
Ingesting or snorting bath salts containing synthetic stimulants can cause chest pains, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, agitation, hallucinations, extreme paranoia, and delusions.
Propoxur is a white, crystalline carbamate and cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide used to combat mosquitoes, flies, ants, fleas and ticks on pets, mites, ticks, cockroaches, aphids, leafhoppers and snails.
It is used on food crops, lawns, flowering plants, in private homes, and public buildings.
Propoxur has largely taken the place of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) when treating black flies and mosquitoes.
Propoxur is toxic to humans when it is absorbed through the skin, inhaled, or ingested.

The infecting agent or prion is a mal-formed version (PrPsc) of a normal protein (PrP) found in all animals.
The malformation of the normal prion proteins occurs when they are exposed to the mal-formed version of the protein.
The normal prion proteins may be more or less susceptible to malformation when they are exposed to the mal-formed protein based on their genetic makeup.
Resistance or susceptibility has been linked to the presence of certain amino acids at various locations within the normal protein.
Genotyping determines the amino acids present at specific locations or codons in the prion protein.
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant animals for breeding and eradication.
Codons associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie include codon 112, 136, 141, 154 and 171.
Codon 171 codes for either arginine Â®, glutamine (Q), histidine (H) or lysine (K).
Resistance or susceptibility has been associated with several different codons but in the US, codon 171 is believed to be the major determinant of relative scrapie susceptiblity.
The presence of R at codon 171 has been associated with increased resistance to scrapie.
The presence of Q at codon 171 has been associated with increased susceptibility to scrpaie.
The presence of H or K has not been closely associated with resistance or susceptibility and are therefore assumed to be susceptible and equivalent to Q for purposes of the eradication program.

The HEXB gene (hexosaminidase B (beta polypeptide)) is located on chromosome 5q13.
Hexosaminidase B is the beta subunit of the lysosomal enzyme beta-hexosaminidase that, together with the cofactor GM2 activator protein, catalyzes the degradation of the ganglioside GM2, and other molecules containing terminal N-acetyl hexosamines.
Beta-hexosaminidase is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, which are encoded by separate genes.
Both beta-hexosaminidase alpha and beta subunits are members of family 20 of glycosyl hydrolases.
Mutations in the alpha or beta subunit genes lead to an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons and neurodegenerative disorders termed the GM2 gangliosidoses.
Beta subunit gene mutations lead to Sandhoff disease (GM2-gangliosidosis type II).
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

The WS2A (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) gene is located on chromosome 3p14.2-p14.1.
This gene encodes a transcription factor that contains both basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper structural features.
It regulates the differentiation and development of melanocytes retinal pigment epithelium and is also responsible for pigment cell-specific transcription of the melanogenesis enzyme genes.
Heterozygous mutations in the this gene cause auditory-pigmentary syndromes, such as Waardenburg syndrome type 2 and Tietz syndrome.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.
Free T3 (free triiodothyronine) is a measure of free circulating T3, excluding that which is bound to carrier proteins.
This provides a more accurate measure of T3 levels because the carrier proteins can increase or decrease in various conditions artificially inflating or shrinking the total T3.
T3 is discriminating for diagnosing and/or following the treatment of hyperthyroidism.
It is not very useful at the low range of concentrations, so is not very helpful in diagnosing hypothyroidism.
The thyroid delivers 20 times more T4 than T3, so T4 is the more relevant analyte except in special cases.
Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms which manifest as yeasts, molds or a combination.
Yeasts start as individual cells that reproduce by budding.
Molds, which are long filaments or hyphae, grow by apical extension.
Both yeasts and molds are heterotrophic and digest their food externally by absorptive nutrition.
Taxonomically, yeast are characterized by their size and shape, the presence or absence of capsules, conidiogenesis (the process of daughter cell formation), presence of sexual spores, the formation of pseudo-and true hyphae and physiologic data.
Species are differentiated based on the ability to assimilate and ferment carbon sources, and to utilize nitrate as nitrogen.
Some opportunistic fungal pathogens found in humans are dimorphic.
They grow as mycelium in nature and reproduce as yeast in the body.
One example is Candida which can quickly transform from yeast to the hyphal phase in humans; this process helps it invade host tissue.
Lenscale is native to the temperate and tropical regions of North America, but a few species are grown as ornamentals throughout the world because of their attractive greyish foliage.
The different Atriplex species are closely related to each other, and consist of annual and perennial weeds and shrubs.

The percentage of HbA2 varies in some hematologic disorders, but is about double in beta-thalassemia.
The F10 gene encodes for factor X, a vitamin K-dependent protein of the blood coagulation cascade synthesized in the liver.
Factor X is the first component of the final common coagulation pathway and is activated to Xa by factor IXa (intrinsic pathway) or factor VIIa (extrinsic pathway).
The activated factor Xa is then involved in cleaving prothrombin into active thrombin.
Mutations in the F10 gene cause a rare bleeding disorder of variable severity known as factor X deficiency, with severe cases resulting from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, and mild /moderate cases are more commonly heterozygous.
Clinical presentations range from nose bleeds, menorrhagia or post-surgical bleeding in the mild cases to hematuria, hematomas, Gi bleeding, bleeding into joints or tissues in more severe cases.
Unlike the X-linked hemophilias, F10 is located on chromosome 13 so occurs equally in both sexes.
Treament involves factor replacement.
Tianeptine is a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer (SSRE) that is used to treat major depression.
Its mechanism of action is the opposite of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Tianeptine modulates the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors and increases the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.
It also acts on NMDA and AMPA receptors.
Ketobemidone (Cliradon, Ketogan, Ketodur, Cymidon, Ketorax, &c.) is a powerful opioid analgesic.
Its effectiveness against pain is in the same range as morphine, and it also has some NMDA-antagonist properties.
This makes it useful for some types of pain that don't respond well to other opioids.
The most commonly cited equalisation ratio for analgesic doses is 25 mg of ketobemidone hydrobromide to 60 mg of morphine hydrochloride or sulfate and circa 8 mg of ketobemidone by injection.
It is used for all types of severe pain, such as postoperative, cancer, kidney stones and fractures.
Adefovir dipivoxil, previously called bis-POM PMEA, works by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that is crucial for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to reproduce in the body.
Adefovir was initially developed for treatment of HIV, sold under the brand name Preveon.
It was discontinued in 1999 for HIV but later approved in 2002 by the FDA for treatment of hepatitis B (HBV) and sold under the brand name Hepsera..
Adefovir is associated with renal toxicity.
MDM2 gene amplification studies evaluate the number of copies of the MDM2 gene present in a single cell to aid in the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated liposarcoma and benign lipoma.
Amplification is determined based on the MDM2 gene copy number and MDM2 to centromere ratio (CEP12).
An MDM2/CEP12 ratio of >= 2 strongly supports a diagnosis of well-differentiated liposarcoma.
Eszopiclone is a cyclopyrrolones and a benzodiazepine receptor agonist derived from pyridine, pyrazine and piperazine and used to treat insomnia.
Its mechanism of action is to bind to the omega-1 subtype of the alpha subunit of gamma-aminobutyrate-benzodiazepine GABA receptor complex (GABA-A).
GABA-A is a chloride ionophore in the central nervous system, that when bound causes the chloride channels to open, leading to hyperpolarization, inhibition of neuronal firing, and an increase in the inhibition of GABA.
This sequence of events causes an hypnotic response in the patient and induces sleep.
Eszopiclone has insignificant anxiolytic activity and shows no evidence of causing increased liver enzymes in the blood.
The chromosome 11p15 region contains a large cluster of imprinted genes, including H19 (maternally expressed), KCNQ1OT1 (paternally expressed), IGF2 (paternally expressed), and CDKN1C (maternally expressed).
Expression of these genes is controlled by 2 imprinting centers (IC), IC1 and IC2.
Genetic or epigenetic alterations within the genes or the imprinting centers of the 11p15 region cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a clinically heterogeneous overgrowth syndrome associated with neonatal hypoglycemia, congenital malformations, and an increased risk for embryonal tumor development.
The clinical presentation of BWS is dependent on which genes are involved.
Alterations in the 11p15 chromosome region also cause Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, characteristic facies, and asymmetry of the face, body, and/or extremities.
Hypomethylation of the paternal IC1 is identified in 35%-50% of individuals with RSS.
Sulforidazine (Imagotan, Psychoson, Inofal) a typical antipsychotic and a metabolite of thioridazine; it and mesoridazine are more potent than the parent compound, whose pharmacological effects are believed by some to be largely due to its metabolism into sulforidazine and mesoridazine.

The straight line distance between Condylion and Gnathion
The DCX gene (doublecortin) is located on chromosome Xq22.3-q23.
This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family.
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytoplasmic protein and contains two doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules.
In the developing cortex, cortical neurons must migrate over long distances to reach the site of their final differentiation.
The encoded protein appears to direct neuronal migration by regulating the organization and stability of microtubules.
In addition, the encoded protein interacts with LIS1, the regulatory gamma subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and this interaction is important to proper microtubule function in the developing cortex.
Mutations in this gene cause abnormal migration of neurons during development and disrupt the layering of the cortex, leading to epilepsy, mental retardation, subcortical band heterotopia ("double cortex" syndrome) in females and lissencephaly ("smooth brain" syndrome) in males.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
A centrally active drug that apparently both blocks serotonin uptake and provokes transport-mediated serotonin release.
The 5' UTR (untranslated region) of the human rhinovirus (HRV) genome is highly conserved with gene sequences similar to other enterovirus species.
PCR-based assays targeting the 5' UTR provide high sensitivity for detecting rhinoviruses but may require an additional step, such as hybridization with specific probes, to distinguish between enterovirus- and rhinovirus-positive samples.
Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that infects cats.
As a retrovirus, FeLV is transmitted as an RNA virus but the RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA.
Retroviruses contradict the Central dogma of molecular biology.
FeLV is usually transmitted between infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved.
If not defeated by the animal's immune system, the virus can be lethal.
The disease caused by this virus is a form of cancer of blood cells called lymphocytes (a leukemia).
The bispectral index (BIS) is a quantitative measure of depth of anesthesia, specifically the level of consciousness.
The BIS at any point in time is based on the prior 15 to 30 seconds of EEG data, and index values range from 0 to 100.
No measurable cortical activity would result in a BIS of 0, and a typical awake state is usually associated with an index of 90-100.
Typical values for a patient undergoing general anesthesia are 40-60.

Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochetal bacterium that is closely related to the Borrelia species that causes tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), and it is more distantly related to the Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease.
First identified in 1995 in ticks from Japan, B. miyamotoi has since been detected in two species of North American ticks, the black-legged or "deer" tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus).
These ticks are already known to transmit several diseases, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis.
Patients with B. miyamotoi infection are most likely to have fever, chills, and headache.
Other common symptoms included body and joint pain and fatigue.
Unlike Lyme disease, rash is uncommon, presenting in only 4 out of 51 patients.
Patients infected with B. miyamotoi have been treated with a 2-4 week course of doxycycline, amoxicillin, or ceftriaxone.
Fewer than 60 well-documented cases of human infection have been reported in the United States as of July 2015.
The route of transmission of B. miyamotoi to humans has not been firmly established, but likely involves the bite of infected black-legged ticks.

It has been differentiated into three cultivated vegetables, namely leek, elephant garlic and kurrat.
In tidewater Virginia, the plant is commonly known as the "Yorktown Onion.
Fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, is primarily produced in bone and helps regulate phosphate and vitamin D metabolism by binding to receptors on renal tubular cells.
Intact FGF23 is the bioactive form that is produced after removal of a signal peptide from the inactive FGF23 precursor, and consists of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain.
Intact FGF23 is cleaved into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, which are no longer active.
The production of FGF23 is regulated by a variety of factors, including calcium and phosphate levels, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and iron deficiency.
Elevated FGF23 levels are associated with chronic kidney disease as well as cardiovascular disease.

Vitamin A plays a role in several important physiological processes, including vision, embryonic development, gene expression, and immune function.
The major source of dietary vitamin A is in the form of provitamin A carotenoids, which are found in vegetables, fruits and grains, and about one-third is consumed as preformed vitamin A, which is found in dairy and meat products.
Provitamin A carotenoids include beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, and both alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin have about half the vitamin A activity of beta-carotene.
Carrots are the major contributor to both alpha- and beta-carotene, and cantaloupe, broccoli, squash, peas, and spinach also contain beta-carotene.
Fruits are the sole contributors of beta-cryptoxanthin.
DNA mismatch repair proteins Mlh1, Msh2 and Msh6, and PMS2, an endonuclease, are all part of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR).

MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) gene is located on the X chromosome and produces the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme that degrades amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.
A polymorphism located upstream of the MAOA gene contains a 30 base pair variable number of tandem repeats sequence (VNTR) with 2, 3, 3.5, 4, or 5 repeated copies.
The polymorphism has been shown to affect the transcriptional activity of the MAOA gene promoter by gene fusion.
Transcription of the 2 or 3-repeat (short) alleles results in reduced MAOA activity and consequently increased levels of serotonin and other amine neurotransmitters, which is thought to increase the risk for aggression and psychiatric disorders.
Alleles consisting of 3.5 or 4 repeats have shown higher MAOA gene expression and activity than those with 3 repeats.
Disorders associated with the upstream VNTR (uVNTR) genotype and resulting MAO-A enzyme activity include Alzheimer's disease, aggression, panic disorder, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Mutations in the SDHB, SDHC, or SDHD genes are associated with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and paraganglioma (PGL) syndromes.
To date, mutations in SDHA have not been associated with PHEO or PGL syndromes.
Patients with a heterozygous mutation have only one functioning copy of the affected SDH subunit gene.
When the second copy is somatically lost or mutated, tumors develop in tissues.
Germline mutations in the SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes have been found in the majority of familial head and neck paraganglioma (HNPs) as well as in sporadic cases.
Treponema pallidum is a spirochaete bacterium.
Pathogenic treponemes are classified based upon their clinical manifestations in humans: venereal syphilis, yaws, endemic syphilis and pinta.
Nonpathogenic treponemes are often part of the normal flora of the genital tract, oral cavity or intestinal tract.
Treponemal infections exhibit diverse clinical manifestations which are characterized by distinct clinical stages.
Multiplication of the bacterium at the entry point causes the primary stage.
Dissemination of treponemes to other tissues produces the second stage.
After a latency period (up to 20 to 30 years), the tertiary stage develops.
T. palladum subsp pallidum (venereal syphilis) is the most destructive subspecies and produces lesions in many bodily tissues including the central nervous system.

Therefore, assessment of DOCK8 expression on immune cells facilitates the diagnosis of DOCK8 deficiency.
Toxaphene is a mixture of hundreds of different chlorinated camphenes and chlorinated terpenes that result from a reaction between chlorine gas and camphene.
Toxaphene can exist as a gas or yellow waxy solid that smells like pine.
It is a pesticide used heavily in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States to eliminate insects on cotton and other crops, on livestock, and to kill undesirable fish in lakes.
Toxaphene was banned in the United States in 1990.
Toxaphene pollutes the air when it evaporates, the soil by clinging to soil fragments, and water contaminated with it that flows into rivers, lakes and ponds.
Elevated levels of toxaphene are found in predatory fish and mammals where it collects in fatty tissue.

Zinc is an essential mineral naturally present in some foods, added to others, available as a dietary supplement, and found in many cold lozenges and cold remedies.
Zinc plays a role in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division.
Zinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence and is required for proper sense of taste and smell.
A daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state as the body has no specialized zinc storage system.
A wide variety of foods contain zinc.
Oysters contain more zinc per serving than any other food.
Other good food sources include red meat, chicken, beans, nuts, certain types of seafood (such as crab and lobster), whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy products.
Phytates, present in whole-grain breads, cereals, legumes, and other foods, bind zinc and inhibit its absorption.
Thus, the bioavailability of zinc from grains and plant foods is lower than that from animal foods.
Present on the surface of resting mast cells, basophils, Langerhans cells and other cell types.
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also called Human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is a virus of the herpes family (which includes Herpes simplex virus and Cytomegalovirus).

Jagged 1 signalling through notch 1 has also been shown to play a role in hematopoiesis.
A proerythroblast (or rubriblast, or pronormoblast) is the earliest of four stages in development of the normoblast.
In histology, it is very difficult to distinguish it from the other "-blast" cells (lymphoblast, myeloblast, monoblast, and megakaryoblast).
The cytoplasm is blue in an H&E stain, indicating that it is basophilic.
Proerythroblasts arise from the CFU-e (colony-forming unit erythroid) cells, and give rise to basophilic erythroblasts.
In the mouse, proerythroblasts are large committed progenitors that express high levels of transferrin receptor (iron acquisition receptor), the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), some c-Kit (stem cell factor receptor), and are Ter119 (cell surface molecule)-positive.
Their proliferative capacity is more limited compared to the preceding stage, the CFU-e. In vivo, starting with the proerythroblast stage, erythroid cells undergo several more cell divisions while at the same time upregulating survival genes such as Bcl-xL, acquiring and storing large amounts of iron, ramping up the synthesis of hemoglobin and other erythroid genes (in large part a GATA-1 dependent process that is augmented by the EpoR signaling) and decreasing in cell size, eventually removing their nuclei and being released into the bloodstream as a reticulocyte.

It is an Alphavirus found in central, eastern, and southern Africa.
The Semliki Forest virus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of approximately 13,000 base pairs which encodes nine proteins.
Semliki Forest virus is spread mainly by mosquito bites.
It is not able to infect mammals through inhalation or gastrointestinal exposure, although rodents in the laboratory can be infected by intranasal instillation.
The virus is able to cause a lethal encephalitis in rodents, but generally only mild symptoms in humans.
Semliki Forest virus has been used extensively in biological research as a model of the viral life cycle and of viral neuropathy.
Due to its broad host range and efficient replication, it has also been developed as a vector for genes encoding vaccines and anti-cancer agents, and as a tool in gene therapy.

Opipramol is an atypical antidepressant and anxiolytic drug.
It is structurally similar to tricyclic antidepressants, but it has a different mechanism of action.
Opipramol is a sigma-receptor agonist at both the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors, which give it antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, respectively.
It also blocks histamine, serotonin, dopamine and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, but does not affect norepinephrine, dopamine, or serotonin reuptake.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpes-virus family and is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis(IM).
EBV is one of the most common human viruses.
Antibodies to the following antigen complexes can be measured: viral capsid antigen(VCA), early antigen (EA), and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA).
Early antigen antibodies are transient and may last only 1-2 months.
EBV early antigen consists of two components: diffuse and restricted.
Antibody response to EA in IM is usually to the D(diffuse) component, while silent seroconversion to EBV in children usually produces antibodies to the restricted component.
tert-Butyl acetate, or t-butyl acetate is a colorless flammable liquid with a camphor- or blueberry-like smell.
It is used as a solvent in the production of lacquers, enamels, inks, adhesives, thinners and industrial cleaners.

The interRAI Community Health Assessment (interRAI CHA) instrument and its accompanying supplements comprise a robust assessment system.
Everyone receives the core assessment called CHA; only those with specific problem sets receive one or more of the following four supplements: 1) The interRAI Functional Supplement (interRAI CHA-FS) includes an expanded set of functional and clinical items that informs and guides comprehensive care and service planning for more challenged persons in community-based settings; 2) The interRAI Mental Health Supplement (interRAI CHA-MH) includes an expanded item set on mental health- related diagnoses, symptoms, treatments, and life experiences.
The items in this supplement describe the performance and capacity of the person in a variety of domains, with the majority of items serving as specific triggers for care planning.
As with the interRAI CHA-FS, the goal is to use this information to identify individual needs and appropriate interventions; 3) The interRAI Assisted Living Supplement (interRAI CHA-AL) evaluates the needs, strengths, and preferences of persons served by various types of residential care facilities.
The items identify functional, medical, and social issues that are either presently limiting the quality of life or functional status of the person or that are likely to become limiting for the person, if unaddressed; and 4) The interRAI Deafblind Supplement (interRAI CHA-Db) is a standardized set of items that evaluate the strengths, preferences, and needs of persons with dual sensory loss.
The items in this supplement extend the CHA's assessment of the dimensions of vision and hearing to address patterns of impairment and change in these senses for persons with both congenital and acquired deafblindness.
The CHA-Db also includes items on communication systems, orientation and mobility, and use of interpreters and intervenors.
Meadow foxtail is a grass species producing pollen, which may induce hayfever, asthma and conjunctivitis in sensitised individuals.
This plant is native to non-Mediterranean Europe and temperate Asia, and perhaps also to non-desert parts of North Africa.
It is cultivated for forage in Australia, New Zealand and North America.
Meadow Foxtail grass pollen may induce asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane is a chloroalkane.
This colorless, sweet-smelling liquid was produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent.
Although not as toxic as many similar compounds, inhaled or ingested 1,1,1-trichloroethane does act as a central nervous system depressant and can cause effects similar to those of intoxication, including dizziness, confusion, and in sufficiently high concentrations, unconsciousness and death.
Fatal poisonings have been reported and illness linked to trichloroethane from intentional inhalation in the 1980s.
The removal of the chemical from correction fluid commenced due to Proposition 65 declaring it hazardous and toxic.
Prolonged skin contact with the liquid can result in the removal of fats from the skin, resulting in chronic skin irritation.
Studies on laboratory animals have shown that 1,1,1-trichloroethane is not retained in the body for long periods of time.
However, chronic exposure has been linked to abnormalities in the liver, kidneys, and heart.
Pregnant women should avoid exposure, as the compound has been linked to birth defects in laboratory animals.
Norquetiapine is the primary active metabolite of the parent drug quetiapine and is used to treat bipolar depression, major depressive episodes, and generalized anxiety disorder.
Norquetiapine, unlike quetiapine but similar to some other antidepressants, prevents the reuptake of norepinephrine (NE) at the noradrenaline transporter (NET).
The NET is a protein on the surface of noradrenergic neurons that controls the activity of NE by transporting it into the cytoplasm of the noradrenergic neurons.
Norquetiapine partially activates the 5-HT1A receptors which, with the NET, is thought to have antidepressant responses in the patient.
Quetiapine and norquetiapine act together against several target receptors, including NET, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2, to treat antidepressant and anxiolytic symptoms of patients.
CD10, a type II transmembrane protein found on pre-B cells, germinal-center B cells, some neutrophils, kidney cells, T-cell precursors, and epithelial cells that acts as a zinc metalloprotease cleaving peptide bonds on the amino side of hydrophobic amino acids; expressed in acute lymphocytic leukemia and follicular-center-cell lymphomas.
The FLNA gene (filamin A, alpha) is located on chromosome Xq28.
The protein encoded by this gene is an actin-binding protein that crosslinks actin filaments and links actin filaments to membrane glycoproteins.
The encoded protein is involved in remodeling the cytoskeleton to effect changes in cell shape and migration.
This protein interacts with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes, and second messengers.
Defects in this gene are a cause of several syndromes, including periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH1, PVNH4), otopalatodigital syndromes (OPD1, OPD2), frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD), Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and X-linked congenital idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIIPX).
Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
The MYH7 gene (myosin, heavy chain 7, cardiac muscle, beta) is located on chromosome 14q12.
Muscle myosin is a hexameric protein containing 2 heavy chain subunits, 2 alkali light chain subunits, and 2 regulatory light chain subunits.
This gene encodes the beta (or slow) heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin.
It is expressed predominantly in normal human ventricle.
It is also expressed in skeletal muscle tissues rich in slow-twitch type I muscle fibers.
Changes in the relative abundance of this protein and the alpha (or fast) heavy subunit of cardiac myosin correlate with the contractile velocity of cardiac muscle.
Its expression is also altered during thyroid hormone depletion and hemodynamic overloading.
Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myosin storage myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Laing early-onset distal myopathy.
Kynurenine is a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan used in the production of niacin.
L-kynurenine is a central compound of the pathway of tryptophan metabolism pathway since it can change to the neuroprotective agent kynurenic acid or to the neurotoxic agent quinolinic acid.
The break-up of these endogenous compounds' balance can be observable in many disorders.
It can occur in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease, in stroke, in epilepsy, in multiple sclerosis, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in mental failures, such as schizophrenia and depression.

I : Rh-negative unaffected or mildly affected infant.
Terconazole is an anti-fungal medication, primarily used to treat vaginal fungal infections.
If the epithelial cells or other materials do not become immediately incorporated within the hyaline material, they tend to degenerate into coarse granules.
These granules then adhere to the casts, thereby forming coarsely granular casts.
Since coarsely granular casts contain large granules, they are darker in color than finely granular casts.
They can even be dark brown as a result of altered blood pigments.
U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School.
Babesia divergens-like MO-1 strain is a parasite that invades human red blood cells and is transmitted by the Ixodid tick.
Infection by the Babesia species was first discovered in Croatia in 1957, but has proven to exist across the world in the last fifty years.
B. divergens-like Missouri strain primarily infects humans who live in Missouri, Kentucky, and Washington state.
The Babesia parasites possess vesicles that secrete enzymes that facilitates its entrance into the host erythrocytes.
They reproduces asexually in red blood cells and sexually in the Ixodid tick.
Infection with Babesia leads to a wide range and severity of symptoms.
Symptoms that are characterized as mild to moderate include fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia, anorexia cough, arthralgia and nausea.
Symptoms of severe illness are seen most often in patients who are immunosuppressed due to infections like Human immunodeficiency virus and conditions such as cancer.
Severe symptoms of Babesia infection include respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, liver and renal failure, and splenic infarction.
Infection with Babesia divergens-like Missouri strain consistently causes symptoms that are life threatening.
There are several ways to diagnose infections with Babesia including thick and thin smear analysis, polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluorescence antibody, and by injecting patient blood into a hamster and waiting for severe parasitemia to develop in 2-4 weeks.
Treatment of Babesia infection is with antibiotics or exchange transfusion when the parasite load in the blood becomes very high.
The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score is used to quickly determine the likelihood of favorable outcomes for an individual considering stem cell transplantation.
The score is based on five factors related to the patient and the possible donor and include: age of the patient, stage of the disease, time from diagnosis, donor type and donor recipient gender combination.
The possible scores range from 0-7, with worsening transplant outcomes as the risk score increases.
The EBMT risk score remains valid for all acquired hematological disorders, for allogeneic and autologous HSCT (score 0-5), and is not influenced by the type of technology used or by standard or reduced conditioning.
Stem cell transplantation is invariably less successful in older patients with advanced disease, longer time since diagnosis, and with a mismatched donor, than in younger patients who received their transplant quickly while their disease was at an early stage and using a well-matched donor.
The EBMT risk score gives patients a better idea of the likelihood of surviving a HSCT, giving them the choice of other non-transplant options.
Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), an important pregnancy protein is a major biochemical marker of Down syndrome in the first trimester of pregnancy.
The gene of PAPP-A is assigned to human chromosome 9q 33.1.
PAPP-A belongs to the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases.
Maternal serum levels of PAPP-A in the first trimester are significantly lower if the fetus is affected by Down syndrome.
Low first trimester maternal serum levels are found not only in trisomy 21 but also in non-Down syndrome fetal aneuploidies.
PAPP-A may also be an indicator of stable and unstable angina pectoris.

Among the Acinetobacter species, Acinetobacter baumannii accounts for about 80% of reported infections.
Symptoms range from pneumonia to serious blood or wound infections.
Acinetobacter-related infections rarely occur outside of healthcare settings.
Acinetobacter species are resistant to many classes of antibiotics, so treatment is determined on a case-by-case basis.
The FOXL2 (forkhead box L2) gene is located on chromosome 3 at position q22.3.
This gene encodes a forkhead transcription factor.

Two types of FcÎµR are known:
The high-affinity receptor FcÎµRI is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (it has two Ig-like domains).
FcÎµRI is found on epidermal Langerhans cells, eosinophils, mast cells and basophils.
As a result of its cellular distribution, this receptor plays a major role in controlling allergic responses.
FcÎµRI is also expressed on antigen-presenting cells, and controls the production of important immune mediators called cytokines that promote inflammation.
The low-affinity receptor FcÎµRII (CD23) is a C-type lectin.
FcÎµRII has multiple functions as a membrane-bound or soluble receptor; it controls B cell growth and differentiation and blocks IgE-binding of eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils.

Suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) is a member of the interleukin 1 receptor family.
It was discovered in 1989, but in 2002 it was realized that ST2 was excreted by cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes in response to stress.
ST2 has two isoforms which are the transmembrane form (ST2L) and the soluble form (sST2).
They both bind to the ligand Interleukin-33 (IL-33).
When IL-33 binds to ST2L, the complex provides cardiac protection by reducing myocardial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, and improving myocardial function.
When cardiac injury occurs, the IL-33/ST2 system is upregulated in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts.
sST2 becomes strongly attracted to IL-33, competing with ST2L for binding sites.
The IL-33/sST2 system counteracts the cardiac protection provided by the IL-33/ST2L system.
sST2 concentrations are believed to be associated with cardiovascular stress and fibrosis.
As a biomarker, sST2 is a strong predictor of both chronic and acute heart failure outcomes.
sST2 does not appear to be significantly affected by age, gender, body mass index, and renal function.

The CD79A and CD79B genes, located on chromosomes 19 and 17, respectively, encode the alpha and beta chains of the B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein.
When an antigen binds to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex, the B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in internalization of the BCR complex, transport to late endosomes, and antigen presentation.
The beta chain also plays a role in phosphorylation of the alpha chain.
Mutations in CD79B are associated with agammaglobulinemia 6, an autosomal recessive disease associated with low or absent serum antibodies and circulating B-cells that is characterized by severe infections early in childhood.

Silk is produced from the cocoons of silk moths and end-parts of cocoons, short fibres, etc, are combined to form silk waste and are utilized as filling material for e.g. bed quilts and winter clothes.
Silk threads to be used for the production of fabrics go through several processes that remove allergenic proteins.
The silk waste, however, is less carefully processed and retains allergens of the original sources.
Silk is a well-known occupational allergy in silk-industry workers.
Silk waste from wild silk has become an important indoor inhalant allergen due to its use for filling bed quilts and pillows.
Hyaluronan (also called hyaluronic acid or hyaluronate or HA) is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues.
It is unique among glycosaminoglycans in that it is nonsulfated, forms in the plasma membrane instead of the Golgi, and can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions.
One of the chief components of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronan contributes significantly to cell proliferation and migration, and may also be involved in the progression of some malignant tumors.

Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic.
It is most often used as part of a synergistic combination with trimethoprim in a 5:1 ratio in co-trimoxazole, which is also known as Bactrim or Septrin.
It can be used as an alternative to amoxicillin -based antibiotics to treat sinusitis.
Mechanism of action:Sulfonamides are structural anologs and competitive antagonists of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).
They inhibit normal bacterial utilization of PABA for the synthesis of folic acid, an important metabolite in DNA synthesis.
The effects seen are usually bacteriostatic in nature.
Folic acid is not synthesized in humans, but is instead a dietary requirement.
This allows for the selective toxicity to bacterial cells (or any cell dependent on synthesizing folic acid) over human cells.

Trust in science and scientists can greatly influence consideration of scientific developments and activities.
Yet, trust is a nebulous construct based on emotions, knowledge, beliefs, and relationships.
As we explored the literature regarding trust in science and scientists we discovered that no instruments were available to assess the construct, and therefore, we developed one.
Using a process of data collection from science faculty members and undergraduate students, field testing, expert feedback, and an iterative process of design, we developed, validated, and established the reliability of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory.
Our 21-item instrument has a reliability of Cronbach's alpha of .86, and we have successfully field-tested it with a range of undergraduate college students
Veterinary Medicine: Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is a loosely coiled, gram-negative, oxygen tolerant, motile, anaerobic spirochete that causes swine dysentery (SD).
SD, a severe mucohemorrhagic diarrheal disease, is usually seen in pigs that weigh between 15 and 70 kilograms, but can also affect adult and suckling pigs.
SD is transmitted when fecal matter containing B. hyodysenteriae is ingested.
When B. hyodysenteriae is grown on blood agar, there is a characteristic complete hemolysis that distinguishes it from other less pathogenic or nonpathogenic spirochetes.
To definitively diagnose an infection with B. hyodysenteriae, the spirochete must be cultured, isolated and identified using biochemical tests or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
The current treatments for SD includes tylosin, tiamulin and valnemulin.
The CFH gene (complement factor H) is located on chromosome 1q32.
This gene is a member of the Regulator of Complement Activation (RCA) gene cluster and encodes a protein with twenty short consensus repeat (SCR) domains.
This protein is secreted into the bloodstream and has an essential role in the regulation of complement activation, restricting this innate defense mechanism to microbial infections.
Mutations in this gene have been associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and chronic hypocomplementemic nephropathy.
Alternate transcriptional splice variants, encoding different isoforms, have been characterized.
Somatotropin (growth hormone) is essential for normal growth and development in children and helps regulate metabolism in both children and adults.
The pituitary gland produces and releases GH into the blood in pulses throughout the day.
Because growth hormone is released in pulses, a single measurement of the blood level is not normally clinically useful.
Therefore, testing for the suppression or stimulation of growth hormone release from the pituitary is usually done.
GH stimulation (challenge) tests help to diagnose GH deficiency and hypopituitarism.
For a stimulation test, a sample of blood is drawn after 10-12 hours of fasting.
Then, under close medical supervision, a person is given an intravenous solution of a substance that normally stimulates the release of GH from the pituitary.
Blood samples are then drawn at timed intervals and GH levels are tested in each to see if the pituitary gland was stimulated to produce the expected levels of GH.
The most commonly used challenge is arginine, but others include clonidine and glucagon.
Since exercise normally causes an increase in GH, vigorous exercise may also be used as the stimulant for GH release.
GH suppression tests help to diagnose GH excess.
For a suppression test, a sample of blood is drawn after 10-12 hours of fasting.
A person is then given a standard glucose solution (usually 100 grams of glucose) to drink.
Blood samples are drawn at timed intervals and tested for GH to see if the pituitary gland is sufficiently suppressed by the dose of glucose.

Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) is the primary metabolite of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).
After World War II, DDT was heavily used as an insecticide in agricultural and household settings.
It was a main component of garden sprays, vegetable dusts and applied to carpets to eradicate fleas.
DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, but can still be used in emergency health situations to combat mosquitoes infected with malaria and yellow fever, and by prescription to treat body lice.
DDT and DDE are slow to decompose and remain in the environment for a very long time.
DDT and DDE are rarely detected in groundwater since they are nearly insoluble in water, but adhere tightly to soil particles where they can remain for many years.
DDE is at least as toxic as DDT.
Exposure to DDE is mostly by ingesting contaminated food bought in countries where the use of DDT is still prevalent.
Foods commonly found to be polluted with DDT and DDE include root crops, leafy vegetables, fatty meats, fish, and poultry.
Other sources of DDT and DDE in the environment can be found in contaminated air, dust, and water near waste sites and landfills with high levels of DDT and DDE.

Triploidy risk refers to the fetus's risk of being affected by triploid syndrome.
The risk can be determined by prenatal genetic testing of fetal DNA.
Triploid syndrome is caused by the presence of three copies of every chromosome rather than two, for a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the normal 46.
The majority of cases are due to two sperm fertilizing a single egg.
Most fetuses with triploidy are lost due to miscarriage, and the few infants born with triploidy have multiple birth defects and only survive a few months.
Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication selection may be determined based on a patient's genotype for various polymorphisms within the HTR2A and HTR2C genes, which encode the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors HTR2A and HTR2C. Variants in HTR2A, for example c.102T>C and c.-1438G>A, have been found to affect response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and risk for adverse drug reactions as well as response to the antipsychotic drugs clozapine and aripiprazole., Patients treated with antipsychotics and having significant weight gain have been positively correlated with a polymorphism in the promoter region of HTR2C, c.759C>T, where those with the -759T variant allele showed significantly less weight gain than those without this allele.
Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is a viral pathogen infecting both humans and birds (primarily chickens and turkeys).
Four subtypes of aMPV have been identified - A, B, C and D. Avian metapneumovirus causes an acute respiratory infection and is highly contagious.
The significance of the disease in chickens and turkeys is its impact on chicken and turkey flock populations as it can cause death when a secondary infection is present.
In humans, it can be compared with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
When the infection occurs alone, it is less severe than RSV, but when combined with an RSV infection, the manifestation of disease worsens.

The serotonin release assay (SRA) is a functional test for the detection of heparin-dependent antibodies in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Patient's serum is added to donor platelets along with varying concentrations of heparin.
Low heparin causes platelet activation in the presence of positive patient antibodies, with inhibition by excess heparin.
Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) is used most commonly as one of the screening tests to diagnose lupus anticoagulants (LA), which are phospholipid autoantibodies associated with excess clot formation, excess bleeding, and repeated miscarriages.
The coagulant in the venom directly activates factor X, which turns prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of factor V and phospholipid.
If phospholipid antibodies are present, this reaction will be inhibited, which will prolong the dRVVT and suggests the presence of LA.
The ORF5 gene of the porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRS) has been found to be extremely variable, showing polymorphism in both the nucleic acid and amino acid positions of the gene.
This variability has made it a specific target for vaccine development as well as epidemiological investigation.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamus in order to stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and gonadotropins from the pituitary gland.
GnRH release is crucial to the reproductive cycles of both males and females.
In males, GnRH is instrumental in the production of sperm cells in the testes.
In females, GnRH is necessary for conception and regulation of the menstrual cycle.
To ensure the pituitary is coordinating properly with GnRH, an LH response to GnRH blood test is conducted.
In this test, a shot of GnRH is administered to a patient and the LH level is observed over a specified period of time.
The LH response to GnRH test helps to distinguish between primary and secondary hypogonadism.
Lincomycin is an antibiotic that comes from the bacteria Streptomyces lincolnensis.
It has been structurally modified to its more commonly known 7-chloro-7-deoxy derivative, clindamycin.
Although similar in structure, antibacterial spectrum, and in mechanism of action to macrolides they are also effective against other species as well i.e. actinomycetes, mycoplasma, and some species of Plasmodium.
However, because of its adverse effects and toxicity, it is rarely used today and reserved for patients who are either allergic to penicillin or where bacteria has developed resistance.

The anion of mevalonic acid, the predominant form in biological media, is known as mevalonate.
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that restores blood flow to the heart.
During the procedure, a thin, flexible guiding catheter is threaded through a blood vessel over a guide wire to the affected artery.
A guiding catheter can hold other devices, such as a balloon or stent.
Once the guiding catheter is in place, a balloon can be inflated to compress the plaque against the artery wal, or a stent, which is a small mesh tube that is used to open and provide support to narrow or weak arteries, can be placed.
Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961, but because of resistance its usage has declined substantially It can sometimes result in allergic reactions that range in severity from a rash (i.e. patients with mononucleosis) to potentially lethal anaphylaxis.

Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan.
It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity.
It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors.
Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiologic and neuropathologic processes.
As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders.
Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions.
High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients suffering from tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses.
In all these situations increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms.
Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
A kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease.
High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase.
Griseofulvin may be given by mouth in the treatment of tinea infections.
L-serine (L-ser) is an amino acid that plays a central role in cellular proliferation and is the major source of one-carbon groups for the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate.
L-ser is converted to D-ser by serine racemase.
Altered CNS D-ser levels have been associated with a variety of neurologic conditions, including schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.
L-ser also plays a specific role in the CNS, and patients with defects of L-ser synthesis have significant neurological impairment.
Two enzyme defects linked to L-ser synthesis have been discovered: 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-PGDH) deficiency and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) deficiency.
Patients with 3-PGDH deficiency can have significant neurologic impairment, including congenital microcephaly and seizures associated with decreased white matter volume and myelination, and L-ser supplementation has been used to treat the seizures in this patient population.
PSP deficiency has only been identified in one patient, whose symptoms also improved with L-ser treatment.
CD1 (cluster of differentiation 1) is a family of glycoproteins expressed on the surface of various human antigen-presenting cells.
They are related to the class I MHC molecules, and are involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells.
However their precise function is unknown.
CD1 glycoproteins can be classified primarily into two groups which differ in their lipid anchoring.
CD1a, CD1b and CD1c (group 1 CD1 molecules) are expressed on cells specialized for antigen presentation.
CD1d (group 2 CD1) is expressed in a wider variety of cells.
CD1e is an intermediate form, expressed intracellularly, the role of which is currently unclear.
Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats.
It is in the same class of diseases as BSE in cattle and Chronic Wasting Disease in elk and deer.
Transmission of the classical scrapie agent is not completely understood but apparently healthy sheep infected with the agent can transmit disease.
The infecting agent or prion is a mal-formed version (PrPsc) of a normal protein (PrP) found in all animals.
The malformation of the normal prion proteins occurs when they are exposed to the mal-formed version of the protein.
The normal prion proteins may be more or less susceptible to malformation when they are exposed to the mal-formed protein based on their genetic makeup.
Resistance or susceptibility has been linked to the presence of certain amino acids at various locations within the normal protein.
Genotyping determines the amino acids present at specific locations or codons in the prion protein.
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant animals for breeding and eradication.
Codons associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie include codon 112, 136, 141, 154 and 171.
Codon 136 codes for either alanine (A), valine (V) or threonine (T).
The presence of A at codon 136 has been associated with increased resistance to scrapie.
The presence of V at codon 136 has been associated with increased susceptibility to scrapie.
The presence of T at codon 136 has not been associated with scrapie resistance or susceptibility.
Potassium is an important mineral for the body.
Potassium is needed to: build proteins, break down and use carbohydrates, build muscle, maintain normal body growth, control the electrical activity of the heart, and to control acid-base balance.
Many foods contain potassium.
All meats and fish (such as salmon, cod, flounder, and sardines) are good sources.
Soy products and veggie burgers are also good sources of potassium.
Vegetables including broccoli, peas, lima beans, tomatoes, potatoes (especially their skins), sweet potatoes, and winter squash are all good sources of potassium.
Fruits that contain significant amounts of potassium include citrus fruits, cantaloupe, bananas, kiwi, prunes, and apricots.
Milk, yogurt, and nuts are also excellent sources of potassium.
People with kidney problems, especially those on dialysis, should not eat too many potassium-rich foods.

Dengue is caused by any one of four distinct but closely related dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4), which are single-stranded RNA viruses in family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus.
This family includes other important vector-borne viruses (e.g., West Nile virus, Yellow Fever virus, Japanese Encephalitis virus, St. Louis Encephalitis virus, etc.).
Dengue viruses are arboviruses (arthropod-borne virus) transmitted primarily to humans through an infected Aedes species mosquito bite.
Transmission may also occur through transfusion of infected blood or transplantation of infected organs or tissues or after occupational exposure in healthcare settings.
All four dengue serotypes can produce the full spectrum of illness and severity.
The spectrum of illness can range from a mild febrile syndrome to classic dengue fever (DF), to the severe forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).
Diagnosis can include serology, antigen detection or molecular testing.
PCR assays have been devloped that target various areas of the genome including genes for non-structured proteins, the capsid protein, or the 3' or 5' untranslated regions.

Escherichia coli O157 is an enterohemorrhagic strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli and an emerging cause of foodborne illness.
An estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths occur each year in the United States alone, although it is rarer in less industrialized countries.
Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, and occasionally to kidney failure.
Most illness has been associated with eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef, although it is also transmitted by person-to-person contact, produce, drinking unpasteurized milk or swimming in or drinking contaminated water.
The 2006 United States E. coli outbreak was linked to a large quantity of spinach contaminated with this strain.
The C10orf2 gene (chromosome 10 open reading frame 2) is located on chromosome 10q24.
This gene encodes a hexameric DNA helicase which unwinds short stretches of double-stranded DNA in the 5' to 3' direction and, along with mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma, is thought to play a key role in mtDNA replication.
The protein localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and mitochondrial nucleoids.
Mutations in this gene cause infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and are also associated with several mitochondrial depletion syndromes.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.
Cathine, also known as d-norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes which acts as a stimulant.

The nanA gene is common across all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and encodes a sialidase protein (also known as neuraminidase) that plays an important role in the virulence of this pathogen.
Because the nanA gene is conserved across all strains, its presence in clinical specimens can be used to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae as one of the pathogens responsible for a specific infection.
Infliximab is a genetically engineered immunoglobulin 1 murine-human chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±).
The murine portion is the part of the antibody that binds to TNFÎ± while the human portion preserves functional immune capacity.
Infliximab is used to treat Crohn's disease and, in particular, in treating the closure of intestinal or perianal fistulas in patients with acute intestinal involvement who have been unresponsive to other treatments.
TNFÎ± is a cytokine that acts to increase the inflammatory process in CD, RA, psoriasis and spondylarthropathy.
The primary mechanism of infliximab is to combine with the inactivate soluble transmembrane TNFÎ±.
However, infliximab also modulates TNFÎ±-producing cells through complement fixation of antibody-dependent T lymphocytes and monocytes by binding them to the IgG1 fc portion of infliximab.
There is also a subsequent down-regulation of other inflammation-producing cytokines and a reduction of the level of chemokines and endothelial adhesion molecules.
Negative side effects of infliximab include fibrostenosing CD and sepsis.
HPV type 56 has been associated with low grade cervical abnormalities, cancer precursors, and anogenital cancers.

Hard-headed Cabbages were developed in 16th century.
The main growing areas are West Europe and the Baltic countries, the ex-USSR, China, Japan and America.
Cabbage can occasionally induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Proteins of these vegetables may cause immediate-type allergy, the pollens may be involved in hay fever, and skin contact with the isothiocyanates released may cause contact dermatitis.
Neuronal nuclear type 3 Ab (ANNA-3) is one of three neuronal nuclear paraneoplastic antibodies that primarily binds to the nuclei of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and to renal glomerular podocytes.
Symptoms of the presence of ANNA-3 include sensory or sensorimotor neuropathies, cerebellar ataxia, myelopathy, brain stem and limbic encephalopathy.
It's presence in serum is most commonly indicative of a small-cell malignant tumor, most of which are primary tumors of the lung.
Fluorescent staining patterns are used to distinguish ANNA-3 from the other two neuronal nuclear types, ANNA-1 and ANNA-2.
ANNA-3 binds the nuclei of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar cortex more than the molecular neurons, and does not bind granular neurons.
ANNA-3 binds only the nuclei of indentate neurons, while ANNA-1 and ANNA-2 bind both the nuclei and cytoplasm of all neurons.
ANNA-3 binds the nuclei of glomuerular podocytes in of the renal cortex in 10 of 11 sera.
For the same cell type, ANNA-2 binds both the nuclei and cytoplasm in 8 of 32 sera, and ANNA-1 does not bind the podocytes at all.

Veterinary Medicine: The causes for abortions in swine are separated into two categories: primary infections of the reproductive tract that result in 30-40% of abortions, mummies and stillbirths; the second category includes toxins, environmental and nutritional stresses, and systemic disease in the sow which account for the remaining 60-70% of aborted fetuses.
To determine the cause of death, fetal serum or thoracic fluid immunoglobulin levels are measured.
Swine fetuses become immunocompetent after 70 days of gestation.
Healthy fetal pigs are born without immunoglobulins and immunoglobulins from the sow do not cross the placenta.
So, any immunoglobulins found in the deceased pig is an indication that an infectious agent most likely caused its demise, rather than an environmental or non-infectious cause.
Hetacillin is a beta-lactam.
Hetacillin is a prodrug and it has no intrinsic antibacterial activity, but is converted by the body to ampicillin, which is active against a variety of organisms.
The human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B;) plays an important role in how the immune system recognizes and responds to pathogens.
HLA-B belongs to a class of molecules that are found on the surface of most cells.
These molecules are responsible for presenting peptides to immune cells.
Peptides derived from normal human proteins are recognized as such, whereas foreign peptides derived from pathogens trigger an immune response.
Allopurinol specifically interacts with HLA-B*58:01 and alters the repertoire of self-peptides that are presented to T lymphocytes, which activates an immune reaction known as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Lipopolysaccharide binding proteins (LBP) are encoded by the LBP gene and involved in the acute-phase immunologic response to gram negative bacterial infections.
LBP mediates the binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to the CD14 receptor, triggering a pro-inflammatory response of macrophages, which is thought to be crucial for keeping infections under control.
Elevated LBP serum concentrations therefore is a potential marker for early diagnosis of an invasive bacterial infection.

It is extremely toxic to aquatic wildlife and bioaccumulates in fish.
Heat-labile enterotoxins are proteins produced by strains of Escherichi coli (EC), Vibrio cholerae (VC), and Clostridium perfringens (CP) that cause diarrhea.
EC and VC enterotoxins consist of five B subunits and one A subunit.
The B subunits bind to a ganglioside receptor on the membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells.
After binding to the intestinal epithelium, subunit A is transferred to the epithelial cytoplasm where it becomes activated.
Once activated, subunit A causes a series of reactions that lead to the secretion of large quantities of ions and fluid to be secreted from the cell, resulting in diarrhea.
A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine.
Neostigmine, unlike PHYSOSTIGMINE, does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are those that contain more than one double bond.
Streptococcus pyogenes is an important cause of pharyngitis as well as more severe infections, including sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.
The csrS gene is associated with S pyogenes virulence, and therefore, its presence in clinical specimens can be used to identify this organism as one of the pathogens responsible for a specific infection.
Cryptosporidium hominis, along with Cryptosporidium parvum, is among the medically important Cryptosporidium species.
It is an obligate parasite of humans that can colonize the gastrointestinal tract resulting in the gastroenteritis and diarrhea characteristic of cryptosporidiosis.
Unlike C. parvum, which has a rather broad host range, C. hominis is almost exclusively a parasite of humans.
As a result, C. hominis has a low zoonotic potential compared to C. parvum.
It is spread through the fecal-oral route usually by drinking water contaminated with oocyst laden feces
The Persimmon tree is native to China and Japan, where it has been cultivated for centuries.
It was introduced to Europe and California (where it has become D. virginiana or American persimmon) in the mid-19th century.
It is commercially grown in Italy, Spain and the south of France, where it is known as Kaki, but it is still most common in the Far East.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Persimmon can occasionally induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals; however, few studies have been reported to date.

Gangliosides are a family of molecules that are present throughout the body but especially prevalent in cells of the nervous system.
Specific gangliosides are named for the carbohydrate sequence they contain and have a unique distribution within the nervous system.
The oligosaccharide groups on gangliosides act as cell surface markers that play a role in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication, and they also act as specific receptors for certain pituitary glycoprotein hormones and certain bacterial protein toxins such as cholera toxin.
Anti-ganglioside antibodies, primarily IgG, are present in the sera from approximately 60% of patients with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), and antibodies against different gangliosides are associated with different forms of GBS.
1. Antibodies against GD1a/GD1b and GD1b/GT1b complexes have been found in patients with more severe GBS requiring mechanical ventilation; 2. Antibodies against GM1 or those against GalNAc-GD1a have been associated with acute motor axonal neuropathy; 3. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are specifically associated with a variant of GBS called Fisher syndrome, which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia and ataxia.
Detection of specific markers early in the course of GBS may help guide the plan of care.

A cold agglutinin is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces antibodies against red blood cells, causing the cells to agglutinate (clump together).
These antibodies are usually IgM.
The primary form of cold agglutinin disease is idiopathic.
In other cases, the disease is a result of an underlying condition.
Cold aggulitinin disease is known to occur in adults with a lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphoma and chronic lymphoid leukemia, and in children with infections such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, mononucleosis, and HIV.
Cold agglutinins affect many blood tests, such as red blood cell count, and by default, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume.
If these indices are very high, a technologist should suspect a cold agglutinin.

It is a component of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events.
It appears that they concentrate in lipid rafts.
They have recently been found to be highly important in immunology.
Natural and semisynthetic gangliosides are considered possible therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.
Gangliosides are more complex glycosphingolipids in which oligosaccharide chains containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) are attached to a ceramide.
NeuNAc, an acetylated derivative of the carbohydrate sialic acid, makes the head groups of Gangliosides anionic.
NB: the M in GM2 stands for monosialo, i.e., one NeuNAc residue.
GM2 is the second monosialo ganglioside characterized, thus the subscript 2.
Their structural diversity results from variation in the composition and sequence of the sugar residues.
In all Gangliosides, the ceramide is linked through its C-1 to a Î²-glucosyl residue, which, in turn, is bound to a Î²-galactosyl residue.

The distinction between different bile acids is minute, depends only on presence or absence of hydroxyl groups on positions 3, 7, and 12.
Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver.
Bile acids are also steroidal amphipathic molecules derived from the catabolism of cholesterol.
They modulate bile flow and lipid secretion, are essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and have been implicated in the regulation of all the key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis.
Bile acids recirculate through the liver, bile ducts, small intestine and portal vein to form an enterohepatic circuit.
They exist as anions at physiological pH and, consequently, require a carrier for transport across the membranes of the enterohepatic tissues.
The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients.
Bile acids have potent toxic properties (e.g., membrane disruption) and there are a plethora of mechanisms to limit their accumulation in blood and tissues.,,,

The coronary artery segmentation model published in 1975 by the American Heart Association (AHA) divides the coronary arteries into 15 segments for the purposes of evaluating and treating coronary artery disease.
The diseased area(s) (also called "lesion") can be described in terms of the specific coronary segments where each lesion starts and ends.
This model is still used as of 2015, with modifications by different disciplines.
The 15 AHA segments are defined as follows: 1) proximal right coronary artery; 2) mid right coronary artery; 3) distal right coronary artery; 4) posterior descending branch of right coronary artery; 5) left main coronary artery; 6) proximal left anterior descending artery; 7) mid left anterior descending artery; 8) distal left anterior descending artery; 9) first diagonal branch; 10) second diagonal branch; 11) proximal left circumflex artery; 12) obtuse marginal artery; 13) mid distal left circumflex; 14) posterolateral branch of left circumflex artery; and 15) posterior descending branch of left circumflex artery.
The 16 segment model is a modified version of the 15-segment AHA model and adds the intermediate branch artery (ramus intermedius), which originates from the left main coronary artery between the left anterior descending and left circumflex in cases of trifurcation, as segment 16.
An individual patient may not have the exact coronary segments described by this model and may have missing and/or additional segments, which can be evaluated by procedures such as angiography.
Depending on the context, the AHA segments may be further subdivided in order to provide finer anatomic granularity.

Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats.
It is in the same class of diseases as BSE in cattle and Chronic Wasting Disease in elk and deer.
Transmission of the classical scrapie agent is not completely understood but apparently healthy sheep infected with the agent can transmit disease.
Sheep and goats are typically infected as young lambs or kids, though adult sheep and goats can become infected.
The infecting agent or prion is a mal-formed version (PrPsc) of a normal protein (PrP) found in all animals.
The malformation of the normal prion proteins occurs when they are exposed to the mal-formed version of the protein.
The normal prion proteins may be more or less susceptible to malformation when they are exposed to the mal-formed protein based on their genetic makeup.
Resistance or susceptibility has been linked to the presence of certain amino acids at various locations within the normal protein.
Genotyping determines the amino acids present at specific locations or codons in the prion protein.
These are reported as a pair of one character amino acid codes such as RR, RH, QQ, etc.
This testing does not diagnosis Scrapie, but is an important tool for selecting genetically resistant animals for breeding and eradication.
Codons associated with susceptibility/resistance to scrapie include codon 112, 136, 141, 154 and 171.
Codon 112 codes for either methionine (M) or threonine (T).
The presence of T at codon 112 has been associated with increased resistance to scrapie.

Mutations in RREB1, CDKN2A, and D8Z2 genes are associated with malignant melanocytic lesions arising in the skin.
While many lesions can be easily classified as benign nevi or malignant melanoma based on histologic features alone, a significant subset of lesions require additional testing to determine their status.
Because the course of treatment for malignant melanoma relative to benign lesions varies significantly from the time of diagnosis, accuracy and expediency of the diagnosis are necessary.
Gene mutation analysis for RREB1, CDKN2A, and D8Z2 genes aid in the differentiation of benign from malignant melanocytic lesions.

The Influenza nucleoprotein antibody test is useful as a screening test for detection of type A influenza viruses such as swine influenza virus (SIV), and influenza A viruses in other species such as equine, canine, and feline.
Influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) switches RNA synthesis from transcription mode to replication mode.
It is therefore vital to the infectious cycle of the influenza virus.
Although it is required for this process, the function of NP in replication is not yet clear.
Research suggests that the common ancestor of the H1N1 human and classical swine viruses is an avian virus rather than human or swine influenza A viruses.

The SCO1 gene (SCO1 cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein) is located on chromosome 17p13.1.
Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the transfer of reducing equivalents from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and pumps protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
In yeast, 2 related COX assembly genes, SCO1 and SCO2 (synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase), enable subunits 1 and 2 to be incorporated into the holoprotein.
This gene is the human homolog to the yeast SCO1 gene.
Lactose is a sugar found in milk and milk products.
The small intestine, the organ where most food digestion and nutrient absorption take place, produces an enzyme called lactase, which breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar: glucose and galactose.
People with small intestinal lactase deficiency cannot digest much lactose, which may cause lactose malabsorption.
In lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down undigested lactose and create fluid and gas.
Not all people with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms.
Lactose intolerance is usually diagnosed by patient history, physical exam, and the hydrogen breath test and/or stool acidity test.
Although it is rarely done, the reference standard for diagnosing lactase insufficiency is directly measuring lactase activity in a duodenal biopsy specimen.

The WAS gene (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) is located on chromosome Xp11.4-p11.21.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) family of proteins share similar domain structure, and are involved in transduction of signals from receptors on the cell surface to the actin cytoskeleton.
The presence of a number of different motifs suggests that they are regulated by a number of different stimuli, and interact with multiple proteins.
Recent studies have demonstrated that these proteins, directly or indirectly, associate with the small GTPase, Cdc42, known to regulate formation of actin filaments, and the cytoskeletal organizing complex, Arp2/3.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare, inherited, X-linked, recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia, and is caused by mutations in the WAS gene.
The WAS gene product is a cytoplasmic protein, expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which show signalling and cytoskeletal abnormalities in WAS patients.

Triacylglycerol lipase (also known as triglycerol lipase) is an enzyme produced by the pancreas in order to break down dietary fats into fatty acids.
The triacylglycerol lipase travels from the pancreatic duct to the duodenum where it hydrolyzes triglycerides.
Triacylglycerol levels in the blood are measured to monitor pancreatic function.
Elevated levels of triacylglycerol lipase indicate a pancreatic disorder or pancreatic damage, including pancreatic duct obstruction, pancreatic cancer, gall bladder inflammation, or kidney disease.
A decreased level of triacylglycerol lipase in the blood can indicate the malfunctioning of the lipase-producing cells in the pancreas.
Lipase levels in peritoneal dialysis fluid can help determine the etiology of abdominal peritonitis.
Patients with peritonitis due to pancreatitis have significantly higher levels of lipase in peritoneal dialysis fluid compared to patients without pancreatitis.
Microscopy is a technique that uses microscopes to examine objects too small to be seen with the naked eye.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a change in the number of repeats of a specific DNA marker in cancer cells compared to the number of repeats present in non-cancerous cells of the same patient.
Different tumor types are associated with different MSI markers, and both the presence of MSI in specific markers as well as the the number of distinct markers demonstrating MSI is important.
Tumor cells are classified as being stable, having high instability (MSI-H), or having low instability (MSI-L) based on the number of markers demonstrating MSI.
MSI analysis may help guide therapy and be a prognostic indicator.
Specific MSI markers include BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, D17S2720, NR21, NR24 and MONO27.
MSI has been most studied in colorectal cancer, and colorectal tumors that are MSI-H are more likely to be carcinomas than adenomas.
MSI has also been studied in other types of cancer, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and Wilms tumor.

Thioridazine (Mellaril, Melleril, Sonapax, Thioril) is a piperidine typical antipsychotic drug of the phenothiazine drug class and was previously widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis.
Due to concerns about cardiotoxicity and retinopathy at high doses it has been withdrawn in many countries (including the UK and Australia) and in other countries it is not commonly prescribed, reserved for patients who have failed to respond to, or have contraindications for, more widely used antipsychotics.
It has been tried with some success as a treatment for various psychiatric symptoms seen in patients with dementia.
Thioridazine is known to kill intracellular extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and both inhibit MRSA directly but also increase the susceptibility of MRSA to Î²-lactam antibiotics at clinical concentrations.
It also appears to increase the efficacy of standard antimicrobial agents (even ones to which the strain in question is resistant) in treating XDR-tuberculosis (XDR-TB) via inhibiting bacterial efflux pumps.(Wikipedia)
C-terminal, also known as copeptin, is a 39-amino acid glycopeptide that comprises the C-terminal part of provasopressin, a precursor of vasopressin.

The Toscana virus (TOSV) belongs to the Bunyaviridae family whose genome is made of three negative single-stranded RNA segments.
There are two genotypes of TOSV:
A, found mainly in Italy, and B, occurring mainly in Spain.
The distribution of the two genotypes may indicate the involvement of different vectors.
Infection by TOSV is most prevalent in Italy and Spain in the summer months, though the geographical region where TOSV is expanding includes other countries in the Mediterranean basin.
TOSV is transmitted to humans by the Phlebotomus species of sandflies.
Though the animal reservoir has not been identified, TOSV has been isolated from the brain of a bat, which raises the question of it possibly being a host to the virus.
TOSV causes aseptic meningitis in 95% of the people it infects, meningoencephalitis in 4.5% of those infected, and an influenza-like illness in the remaining .5% who are infected.
Recently, unusual symptoms associated with TOSV have included ischemic complications and hydrocephalus.
TOSV is emerging as an important pathogen as its distribution increases due to changes in the climate, globalization and habitat modification.
Other than supportive therapy, there is no treatment for infection with TOSV.
DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the TOP2A gene.
This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme that controls and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription.
This nuclear enzyme is involved in processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication.
It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA.
Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event.
The gene encoding this form, alpha, is localized to chromosome 17 and the beta gene is localized to chromosome 3.
The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents and a variety of mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance.
Reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in ataxia-telangiectasia.

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is a small, nonenveloped DNA virus that is associated with disease in pigs.
PCV2 isolate typing is important for epidemiologic purposes, both within a single farm, regionally, and globally.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis is used to determine the "cutting pattern" for an isolate based on three different enzymes with known patterns.
As a hypothetical example, one enzyme may be known to cut a specific 500 base pair (bp) segment of DNA into two pieces that are 200 and 300 bp, or three pieces that are 50, 150 and 300 bp, or to not cut the segment at all depending on the nucleotide sequence in that specific sample.
The two piece pattern might be labeled "1", the three piece pattern "2", and the single, original piece "3".
The individual pattern numbers for three different enzymes are put together as a single RFLP pattern, e.g., 3-1-2 or 1-1-1.
Each of these RFLP patterns identifies a unique strain of PCV2, which information is used for epidemiologic analysis such as determining the source of an outbreak and tracking the spread of disease.

The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to evaluate the functionality of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.
The aPTT can only detect deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII and only if the deficiency is 20-40% of normal.
Mixing studies are used to determine if a prolonged aPTT is due to a clotting factor deficiency or an anticoagulant.
The patient plasma is diluted with pooled normal plasma and the aPTT is run on that dilution.
If the dilution of patient plasma with normal plasma corrects the aPTT, then the patient most likely has a factor deficiency.
If the diluted patient plasma does continues to have a prolonged aPTT, then an anticoagulant is suspected.
Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted by sandflies and caused by intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania.
Human infection is caused by about 21 of 30 species that infect mammals, including the L. donovani complex with 3 species (L. donovani, L. infantum, and L. chagasi); the L. mexicana complex with 3 main species (L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, and L. venezuelensis); L. tropica; L. major; L. aethiopica; and the subgenus Viannia with 4 main species (L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (V.) guyanensis, L. (V.) panamensis, and L. (V.) peruviana).
The different species are morphologically indistinguishable, but they can be distinguished by isoenzyme analysis, molecular methods, or monoclonal antibodies.
Leishmaniasis is found in about 88 countries, most in the tropics and subtropics.
More than 90 percent of the world's cases of visceral leishmaniasis are in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and Brazil.

Animal and plant proteins are made up of about 20 common amino acids.
Amino acids are required for the synthesis of body protein and other important nitrogen-containing compounds, such as creatine, peptide hormones, and some neurotransmitters.
Although allowances are expressed as protein, the biological requirement is for amino acids.
The proteins of the body are continually being broken down and re-synthesized in a process called protein turnover.
Protein is the main source of nitrogen and accounts for about 16% of the protein weight.
Protein deficiency rarely occurs as an isolated condition, and usually results from insufficient food intake.
The symptoms are most commonly seen in malnourished children in poor countries.
Proteins are found in both animal and plant foods.

Zirconium, chemical element Zr and atomic number 40, is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that resembles hafnium, and is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier, and in small amounts as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion.
Materials fabricated from zirconium metal and its oxide (ZrO2) are used in space vehicle parts for their resistance to heat and in some abrasives, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper.
Zirconium containing compounds are also used in many biomedical applications such as dental implants and other restorative practices, knee and hip replacements, and middle-ear ossicular chain reconstruction.
Zirconium binds urea, a property that has been utilized extensively for renal dialysis patients, as a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends a 5 mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10 mg/m3 short-term exposure limit for air dust.
Zirconium compounds have no known biological role and are not considered an industrial health hazard.
Reports of zirconium related adverse reactions are rare and there is no evidence that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.

The VKORC1 gene (vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1) is located on chromosome 16p11.2.
Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting but must be enzymatically activated.
This enzymatically activated form of vitamin K is a reduced form required for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in some blood-clotting proteins.
The product of this gene encodes the enzyme that is responsible for reducing vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to the enzymatically activated form.
Fatal bleeding can be caused by vitamin K deficiency and by the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, and it is the product of this gene that is sensitive to warfarin.
In humans, mutations in this gene can be associated with deficiencies in vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors and, in humans and rats, with warfarin resistance.
Two pseudogenes have been identified on chromosome 1 and the X chromosome.
Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described.

Purkinje cell cytoplasmic-Tr (PCA-Tr) antibodies are associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The clinical presentation that corresponds with PCA-Tr antibodies includes paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and limbic encephalopathy (LE).
PCD and LE are types of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS), an autoimmune disorder that is manifested by progressive neurological syndromes of any combination of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems.
The antibodies that attack the neural tissue develop in response to tumor cells.
The neurological symptoms include encephalitis, autonomic failure, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, visual complaints and more.
The neoplasm may or may not be detectable using conventional imaging modalities.
Since PNS can be associated with multiple antibodies, testing usually includes a panel of PNS antibodies.
In addition, the different PNS antibodies are associated with certain cancers so the antibody pattern can assist in identifying the specific tumor if it was previously undiagnosed.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family of proteins, which are involved in physiologic processes including cell growth and differentiation, and embryonic development.
FGF21 is involved in energy regulation and has been associated with weight loss and decreased triglyceride accumulation in the liver.
In humans, fructose ingestion has been associated with an increase in circulating FGF21, and obesity may lead to FGF21 resistance.
In contrast, in animal studies, increased levels of FGF21 have been found with fasting and ketogenic diets.
The N-terminus of FGF21 binds to the FGF receptor and the C-terminus binds to a co-receptor; therefore, the intact form of FGF21 must be present for FGF receptor activation because binding at both sites is required.
The Apple is the pomaceous fruit of the Apple tree, species Malus domestica in the Rosaceae (Rose) family.

It is produced in relatively small quantities, accounting for (with isophorone diisocyanate) only 3.4% of the global diisocyanate market in the year 2000.
Aliphatic diisocyanates are used in special applications, such as enamel coatings which are resistant to abrasion and degradation from ultraviolet light.
These properties are particularly desirable in, for instance, the exterior paint applied to aircraft.
Tryptophan is an amino acid needed for normal growth in infants and for nitrogen balance in adults.
It is an essential amino acid, which means your body cannot produce it; you must get it from your diet.
The body uses tryptophan to help make niacin and serotonin.
Serotonin is thought to produce healthy sleep and a stable mood.
In order for tryptophan in the diet to be changed into niacin, the body needs to have enough: iron, riboflavin, and vitamin B6.
High tryptophan foods include nuts, seeds, tofu, cheese, red meat, chicken, turkey, fish, oats, beans, lentils, and eggs.
The GRN gene (granulin) is located on chromosome 17q21.32.
Granulins are a family of secreted, glycosylated peptides that are cleaved from a single precursor protein with 7.5 repeats of a highly conserved 12-cysteine granulin/epithelin motif.
The 88 kDa precursor protein, progranulin, is also called proepithelin and PC cell-derived growth factor.
Cleavage of the signal peptide produces mature granulin which can be further cleaved into a variety of active, 6 kDa peptides.
These smaller cleavage products are named granulin A, granulin B, granulin C, etc. Epithelins 1 and 2 are synonymous with granulins A and B, respectively.
Both the peptides and intact granulin protein regulate cell growth.
However, different members of the granulin protein family may act as inhibitors, stimulators, or have dual actions on cell growth.
Granulin family members are important in normal development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis.

Rouleaux (singular rouleau) are stacks of red blood cells (RBCs) which form because of the unique discoid shape of RBCs in vertebrates.
The flat surface of the discoid RBCs provides a large surface area that allows the cells to stick to each other, thus forming rouleaux.
Rouleaux occurs when the plasma protein concentration is high, leading to increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
The presence of rouleaux does not always indicate the presence of a disease.
Conditions which cause rouleaux formation include infections, inflammatory and connective tissue disorders, and cancers.
It also occurs in diabetes mellitus and is one of the causes leading to microvascular occlusions in diabetic retinopathy.
The extent of progressive sperm motility is related to pregnancy rates.
As an assessment of sperm motility, 100 spermatozoa are counted and given a grade for progressive motility of 1,2,3,or 4, with 1 being the slowest and 4 the fastest.
Grade sperm 1 are sluggish and make little forward progress.
Grade 2 sperm move forward but are very slow or do not move in a straight line.
The result is the percentage of the combined grades 1 and 2 (lowest to mid-motility).
The total combined percent of grade 1 and 2 sperm should be less than 58% to be considered in range.
Glucose 6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency causes hemolytic anemia following the use of some drugs, bacterial or viral infections, or metabolic disorder such as acidosis.
Three G6PD variants occur frequently and have clinical implications in different ethnic groups.
Heinz bodies may appear in peripheral red blood cells when G6PD-mediated hemolysis occurs.
Younger red cells and reticulocytes contain more G6PD and may cause normal values if blood is collected following a hemolytic crisis.
Synovial fluid is a viscous, yellow-brown liquid found in small amounts in joints, gives shape to eyeballs and is found in connective tissue.
In joints, high levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) in synovial fluid help maintain normal fluid viscosity and joint integrity.
In osteoarthritis, the synovial fluid viscosity and elasticity are both decreased.
Viscosupplementation via injection has been used and is still being researched to determine its effectiveness in osteoarthritis of the knee.
Injections of two milligrams of viscosupplement containing hyaluronic acid by 20 gauge 1.5 inch needles weekly for three weeks may increase synovial fluid viscosity and reduce inflammation and pain for about three months.

Interferon beta-1b (tradenames Betaferon, Betaseron (North America), and Extavia) is a drug in the interferon family used to treat the relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.
It is believed that interferon-beta based drugs achieve their beneficial effect on MS progress via their anti-inflammatory properties.
Studies have also determined that interferon-beta improves the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-which generally breaks down in MS patients, allowing increasing amounts of undesirable substances to reach the brain.
This strengthening of the BBB may be a contributing factor to interferon-beta's beneficial effects.
These studies were carried out in vitro, so it does not necessarily mean it works the same in people.
Patients taking Interferon beta-1b may develop neutralizing antibodies to the medication.
Closely related is interferon beta-1a, also indicated for MS, and with a very similar drug profile.
Villous lymphocytes circulating in the peripheral blood are a characteristic finding in splenic marginal-zone lymphoma, a rare disorder comprising less than 1% of lymphoid neoplasms.
Villous lymphocytes are characterized by polar cytoplasmic projections, or villi, which sometimes cause them to be mistaken for hairy cells (although hairy cell projections are not polar).
Bedaquiline (trade name Sirturo) is a diarylquinoline anti-tuberculosis drug.
When it was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2012, it was the first time in 40 years that a drug with a different mechanism of action compared to the existing TB treatments had been approved, and it is specifically approved to treat adults with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB).
Badaquiline should only be used when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided.
The most common side effects of bedaquiline in studies were nausea, joint and chest pain, and headache, however the drug also has a black-box warning for life-threatening arrhythmias, as it may induce long QT syndrome by blocking the hERG channel.

The ALPL gene (alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney) is located on chromosome 1p36.12.
There are at least four distinct but related alkaline phosphatases: intestinal, placental, placental-like, and liver/bone/kidney (tissue non-specific).
The first three are located together on chromosome 2, while the tissue non-specific form is located on chromosome 1.
The product of this gene is a membrane bound glycosylated enzyme that is not expressed in any particular tissue and is, therefore, referred to as the tissue-nonspecific form of the enzyme.
The exact physiological function of the alkaline phosphatases is not known.
A proposed function of this form of the enzyme is matrix mineralization; however, mice that lack a functional form of this enzyme show normal skeletal development.
This enzyme has been linked directly to hypophosphatasia, a disorder that is characterized by hypercalcemia and includes skeletal defects.
The character of this disorder can vary, however, depending on the specific mutation since this determines age of onset and severity of symptoms.
Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.

Patients with ergotism present with convulsive and gangrenous symptoms.
The gangrenous symptoms are due to vasoconstriction induced by the alkaloids of the fungus.
Marburg virus or simply Marburg is the common name for the genus of viruses Marburgvirus, which contains one species, Lake Victoria marburgvirus.
The virus causes the disease Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever (MHF), also referred to as Marburg Virus Disease, and previously also known as green monkey disease due to its primate origin.
Marburg originated in Central and East Africa, and infects both human and nonhuman primates.
The Marburg Virus is in the same taxonomic family as Ebola, and both are identical structurally although they elicit different antibodies.
TAFI (Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor) is a glycoprotein of a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 daltons and it belongs to the metalloprotease family, synthesized in the liver, and circulates in blood as a proenzyme without biological activity.
TAFI is also called procarboxypeptidase U (CPU), procarboxypeptidase R (CPR), and plasma procarboxypeptidase B (CPB), and provides an essential link between fibrinolysis and coagulation cascade.
Activated TAFI protects the fibrin clot against lysis.
Defects in thrombin generation directly impact the protection of clots against lysis, thus defects in activation of TAFI may add to the severity of bleeding disorders.
On the other hand, an increased activation of TAFI due to an increased rate of thrombin generation, may lead to thrombotic disorders.
TAFI may also have an important function in the regulation of inflammation, wound healing and blood pressure.
Elevated TAFI levels may form a mild risk factor for venous thrombosis.

Rape originated in northern Europe and was cultivated in the Mediterranean area, but is now grown throughout the world.
Rape seed pollen (and related irritants) can induce asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
It is still unclear whether Rape pollen is a common cause of allergic symptoms, or whether volatile organic compounds from Rape are more frequently responsible for these symptoms.
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is one of thirteen species of dust mites that are found in temperate climates worldwide, and is a major source of mite allergen.
The three most common dust mites include Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei.
Dust mites feed on skin scales and other organic debris.
Their feces and bodies are the source of many of the allergens that affect humans.
House dust mite allergens are divided into 13 groups that are based on their biochemical structure, sequence homology, and molecular weight.
Each allergen is designated by the first three letters of the genus of house mite with which it is associated, then the first letter of the species name, and finally a number that indicates the order in which the allergen was isolated.
Group 1 allergens are glycoproteins that originally lined the intestinal tract of the mite and possess cysteine protease activity.
The epitope Der p 1 increases allergenicity by its ability to split both the CD23 IgE receptor found on the membrane of human B cells, and the CD25 subunit of the T-cell IL-2 receptor.

The CSTB gene (cystatin B (stefin B)) is located on chromosome 21q22.3.
The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain multiple cystatin-like sequences.
Some of the members are active cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps never acquired this inhibitory activity.
There are three inhibitory families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins (stefins), type 2 cystatins and kininogens.
This gene encodes a stefin that functions as an intracellular thiol protease inhibitor.
The protein is able to form a dimer stabilized by noncovalent forces, inhibiting papain and cathepsins l, h and b.
The protein is thought to play a role in protecting against the proteases leaking from lysosomes.
Evidence indicates that mutations in this gene are responsible for the primary defects in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM1).
In chemistry, especially biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid often with a long unbranched aliphatic tail (chain), which is either saturated or unsaturated.
Carboxylic acids as short as butyric acid (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids, while fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils may be assumed to have at least 8 carbon atoms, e.g. caprylic acid (octanoic acid).
Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, because their biosynthesis involves acetyl-CoA, a coenzyme carrying a two-carbon-atom group.
Industrially, fatty acids are produced by the hydrolysis of the ester linkages in a fat or biological oil (both of which are triglycerides), with the removal of glycerol.
The patient was on oxygen upon arrival to the hospital.

Thymidine synthase is the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) using the methyl donor 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) as a cofactor.
dTMP is critical for DNA repair and replication.
Thymidine synthase has become the target for drugs used in the treatment of some cancers including the drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
The active metabolite of 5-FU combines with the nucleotide binding site of TS which prevents dUMP from being able to bind with TS.
The decreased amount of dUMP leads to decreased cell replication.
Studies have shown that the gene amplification of TS in the tumor cells correlate to resistance to 5-FU.
Biopsies of the skin are done in order to remove skin lesions and determine the specific diagnosis.
Surgical margins are the boundaries of the excised specimen, and in the case of a skin biopsy, the deep margin is the one furthest away from the skin surface.

The Reese-Ellsworth extraocular retinoblastoma staging system applies to cancer that has spread outside of the eye, either to the tissues around the eye or to the central nervous system (CNS), bone marrow, or lymph nodes.
This staging system is based on how much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread.
Details of each stage in the extraocular staging system are as follows: Stage 0 (zero) - the cancer is in the eye (called intraocular) and has not spread outside of the eye.
Most retinoblastoma cases are discovered in Stage 0 and should be classified based on the International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma (ICRB).
Doctors recommend conservative treatment for this stage with no additional adjuvant therapy, meaning no additional treatment after surgery.
Stage I - the eye has already been removed and there is some microscopic spread to the optic nerve.
These patients need adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.
Stage II - the tumor has spread to the optic nerve or the sclera, which is the white part of the eye.
Patients with this stage need adjuvant chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy.
Stage III - the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or the bony cavity that surrounds the eyeball.
Stage III is divided into two substages called stage IIIa and stage IIIb, depending on where the tumor has spread.
The treatment for this stage involves both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Stage IV - the tumor has spread to distant areas of the body outside the eye, via the lymphatic system and blood vessels.
Stage IV is divided into substages called IVa and IVb, and IVb is further divided into IVb1, IVb2, and IVb3, depending on the location of the spread.
This stage of extraocular retinoblastoma is treated with high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell rescue.
Radiation therapy may also be used in addition to high-dose chemotherapy for some patients with stage IV disease.

DNA index (DI), which is associated with DNA ploidy, is a reflection of the average amount of DNA in the tumor cells.
The DI can be measured by flow cytometry or image cytometry, both of which result in a DNA ploidy histogram, where the channel number on the x-axis represents fluorescent intensity or optical density for the two methods, respectively.
All cells with the same quantity of DNA form one peak on the histogram, and with a population of normal cells, the largest peak represents diploid cells in G1 of the cell cycle, and a smaller peak represents cells in G2/M-phase.
When there is a mixed population of normal and tumor cells, two or more G1 peaks will be seen, one for the normal cells and one or more for the tumor cells.
The DI is calculated by dividing the channel number of the tumor cell G1 peak by the channel number of the normal (diploid control) G1 peak.
If the tumor cells are diploid, the DI is 1, and if the cells are aneuploid, the DI is greater than or less than 1.
For example, tetraploid cells have a DI of 2 because they have twice as much DNA content as normal diploid cells, and hypodiploid tumor cells have a DI of <1.

Activated T-cells are characterized by coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR and may be measured as fractions of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations.
In patients with HIV, activated T-cell levels are directly correlated to viral load and inversely correlated to CD4+ T-cell count.
However, activated CD8+ T-cell levels may be more closely related to viral load, and successful treatment with anti-retroviral therapy with resulting decrease in viral load has been associated with a concomitant decrease in activated CD8+ T-cells.
Likewise, increases in CD4+ T-cell counts have been associated with a decrease in the level of activated CD4+ T-cells.
In addition, co-infection in patients with HIV is also associated with CD4+ T-cell activation but not that of the CD8+ T-cell population.

The CYBB gene (cytochrome b-245, beta polypeptide) is located on chromosome Xp21.1.
Cytochrome b (-245) is composed of cytochrome b alpha (CYBA) and beta (CYBB) chain.
It has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes.
CYBB deficiency is one of five described biochemical defects associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).
In this disorder, there is decreased activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase; neutrophils are able to phagocytize bacteria but cannot kill them in the phagocytic vacuoles.
The cause of the killing defect is an inability to increase the cell's respiration and consequent failure to deliver activated oxygen into the phagocytic vacuole.
There are the two types of vancomycin resistance in enterococci.
The first type is intrinsic resistance.
Isolates of Enterococcus gallinarum and E. casseliflavus/E. flavescens demonstrate an inherent, low-level resistance to vancomycin.

Ascariasis is a human disease caused by the parasitic roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides.
Perhaps as many as one quarter of the world's people are infected, and ascariasis is particularly prevalent in tropical regions and in areas of poor hygiene.
Other species of the genus Ascaris are parasitic and can cause disease in domestic animals.
Infection occurs through ingestion of food contaminated with fecal matter containing Ascaris eggs.
The larvae hatch, burrow through the intestine, reach the lungs, and finally migrate up the respiratory tract.
From there they are then reswallowed and mature in the intestine, growing up to 30 cm (12 in.)
in length and anchoring themselves to the intestinal wall.
Infections are usually asymptomatic, especially if the number of worms is small.
They may however be accompanied by inflammation, fever, and diarrhea, and serious problems may develop if the worms migrate to other parts of the body.

In homodimeric form, the encoded protein functions as a dehydrogenase and is found in several multi-enzyme complexes that regulate energy metabolism.
However, as a monomer, this protein can function as a protease.
Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with E3-deficient maple syrup urine disease and lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
The SPINK1 gene (serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1) is located on chromosome 5q32.
The protein encoded by this gene is a trypsin inhibitor, which is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into pancreatic juice.
It is thought to function in the prevention of trypsin-catalyzed premature activation of zymogens within the pancreas and the pancreatic duct.
Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary pancreatitis and tropical calcific pancreatitis.
Oranges, with orange-colored peels and juicy fruit in separable quarter-moon-shaped sections, come from an evergreen tree growing to 9 m tall.
Oranges are the most important commercial citrus fruit.
They were cultivated over 3,000 years ago in China.
They now thrive around the world in warm-climate areas including Portugal, Spain, North Africa and the southern United States.
Orange may induce symptoms of food allergy in sensitised individuals.
Symptoms reported included nausea, pruritis, abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, oral itching, angioedema, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, rhinitis, laryngeal oedema, urticaria, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
Oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is a common symptom.

Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod-shaped flagellated, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, and a member of the genus Salmonella.
Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with S. enterica, which often infects cattle and poultry.
In addition, most of the human pathogenic Salmonella serovars belong to the S. enterica enterica subspecies.
These serogroups include Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Paratyphi, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Choleraesuis.
The serovars can be designated as written in the previous sentence (capitalized and non-italicized following the genus), or as follows: "Salmonella enterica enterica, serovar Typhi.

The Pecan is a deciduous tree, usually 23 to 34m tall but sometimes growing to over 50m.
The tree has a rather narrow crown and usually occurs in forests.
Some Pecan trees are over 150 years old.
They have compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets.
The bark is a pale gray or whitish brown, scaly, and deeply furrowed, and the twigs are hairy.
The trees lose their leaves each year and bear sweet, edible nuts, deep brown in color, that range from 2.5 to 5cm in length.
The Pecan is native to North America.
The range of Pecan covers the warmer temperate zone and subtropical areas.
It is very common in the South and Southeast of the USA, but is also planted far beyond this range.
In the USA, Texas is the largest producer of Pecan nuts, and is second only to Georgia in the production of hybrid (orchard-grown) varieties.
Pecan tree pollen is considered to be highly allergenic, resulting in allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and asthma
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) causes an infection in pigs sometimes known as Blue-Ear Pig Disease.
This economically important pandemic disease causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness and has shown differences in virulence, tissue trophism and replication capabilities among strains.
PRRSV has two genotypes - the North American strain (type 2 PRRSv, with the isolate prototype VR2332) and the European strain (type 1 PRRSv, with the isolate prototype "Lelystad").
Both types were discovered in their local regions around 1990 but they now share worldwide distributions.
These two main genotypes differ genetically by approximately 40%.
Within each genotype there is nucleotide divergence of up to 30% (Leung et al., 2010).
The majority of the nucleotides that make up the two are the same but diversity within each genotype is high with a significant geographic pattern for the various types.
The use of sequence information to compare PRRSV isolates is a valuable tool to monitor PRRSV strains both globally and within a farm over time.
It can differentiate between resident and newly introduced viruses as well as between vaccine and field strains.

The concentration of the mitochondrial protein frataxin can be used to both diagnose and monitor treatment for patients with Friedreich ataxia (FA).
Decreased frataxin protein levels are diagnostic of FA and can be utilized for monitoring known patients.
FA is an autosomal recessive disease affecting approximately 1:50,000 Caucasians.
The disease is clinically characterized by progressive spasticity, ataxia, dysarthria, absent lower limb reflexes, sensory loss, and scoliosis.

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic developed in 1994.
It has an extended spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Cefepime hydrochloride was first introduced in 1994 and is currently marketed under various trade names including Maxipime (Elan Pharma, Maxcef, Cepimax, Cepimex, and Axepim).
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal infection.
It is less commonly referred to as vaginal bacteriosis.
It is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection.
BV is not transmitted through sexual intercourse but is more common in women who are sexually active.
BV is caused by an imbalance of naturally occurring bacterial flora and should not be confused with yeast infection (candidiasis), or infection with Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis), which are not caused by bacteria.
The measles virus (MeV) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus and a member of the Paramyxoviridae family.
Measles was first discovered to be caused by an infectious agent in 1757 by a Scottish physician.
After becoming a notifiable disease in the United States in 1912, there were roughly 6,000 deaths reported each year in the following ten years due to MeV.
The vaccination against MeV become available in the United States in 1963 which caused a rapid drop in MeV infections.
MeV is highly contagious and is transmitted through infected secretions.
Symptoms of infection include fever, malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis.
Later, pathognomonic enanthema (Koplik spots) develop and are followed by a maculopapular rash that appears 14 days after exposure to MeV and spreads from the head, down the trunk, and to the lower extremities.
Patients susceptible to serious complications may experience acute encephalitis and subsequent brain damage, fatal respiratory and neurologic complications, or a rare, fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by behavioral and intellectual deterioration and seizures that begin 7-10 years after the measles infection.
There are 24 genotypes of MeV recognized by the World Health Organization that are categorized by the nucleotide sequences of their hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes.
The region of the N gene that distinguishes between the genotypes is a 450 nucleotide sequence of the carboxyl terminus referred to as N-450.
Sequencing the N-450 region can identify the genotype of the infecting virus.
Because infection by MeV vaccine is sometimes given as a post-exposure prophylactic, it has become important to differentiate MeV wild-type infections from the virus present in the vaccine.
Vaccine strains all belong to genotype A and the wild-type genotype A MeV strains are believed to no longer be circulating.
That being the case, if a patient tests positive for genotype A, then the virus is most likely due to the vaccine.
Also, the region of the N gene between nucleotides 478 and 548 is identical for all genotype A vaccine strains that have been analyzed, and PCR-based assays have been developed based on that region so that genotype A vaccine strains can be identified without having to sequence the entire gene.
Gestrinone was developed in the early 1970s and was tested clinically as a weekly oral contraceptive in European and North American countries.
Without significant advantages over other oral contraceptives and with its high price, gestrinone was no longer used after the Stage II clinical trial.
However, from 1982 aroused widespread interest due to substantial therapeutic effects in treating endometriosis.
Under different endocrine conditions, gestrinone possesses estrogenic, progestational, androgenic, antiestrogenic and antiprogesterone actions.
Starting from gestrinone, chemists can synthesize tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) in one reaction step.
THG is a real designer steroid; designer steroids (chemically modified steroids) pose a threat to the integrity of the sport community.
These compounds have recently been detected in urine specimens from athletes, resulting in temporary or permanent suspension from amateur and/or professional competition. ,

The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons.
Saccharopine is an intermediate in the degradation of lysine, formed by condensation of lysine and alpha-ketoglutarate.
The saccharopine pathway is the main route for lysine degradation in mammal and its first two reactions are catalyzed by enzymatic activities known as lysine-oxoglutarate reductase (LOR) and saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH), which reside on a single bifunctional polypeptide (EC, LOR/SDH).
The reactions involved by saccharopine dehydrogenases have a very strict substrate specificity for L-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH.
LOR/SDH has been detected in a number of mammalian tissues, mainly in the liver and kidney, contributing not only to the general nitrogen balance in the organism but also to the controlled conversion of lysine into ketone bodies.
A tetrameric form has also been observed in human liver and placenta.
LOR activity has also been detected in brain mitochondria during embryonic development, and this opens the question of whether the degradation of lysine has any functional significance during brain development and puts a new focus on the nutritional requirements for lysine in gestation and infancy.
Finally, LOR and/or SDH deficiencies seem to be involved in a human autosomic genetic disorder known as familial hyperlysinemia, which is characterized by serious defects in the functioning of the nervous system, and characterized by deficiency in lysine-ketoglutarate reductase, saccharopine dehydrogenase, and saccharopine oxidoreductase activities.
Saccharopinuria (high amounts of saccharopine in the urine) and saccharopinemia (an excess of saccharopine in the blood) are conditions present in some inherited disorders of lysine degradation.
Hemoglobin not combined with oxygen.
Formed when oxyhemoglobin releases its oxygen.
Pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH), an organic acid, is also a ketone and the simplest alpha-keto acid.
The carboxylate (COOH) ion (anion) of pyruvic acid, CH3COCOO-, known as pyruvate, is a key intermediary in several metabolic pathways.
It can be made from glucose through glycolysis and it supplies energy to living cells via the citric acid cycle.
It can also be converted to carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, fatty acids or generate energy through acetyl-CoA, the amino acid alanine, and ethanol.
The bacterial (CTX-M) gene is targeted to detect CTX-M type beta lactamases, a group of class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that are a common cause of community-acquired infections.
They exhibit powerful activity against cefotaxime and ceftriaxoane.
CTX-M type ESBLs are rapidly spreading among Enterobacteriaceae worldwide and replacing TEM-type and SHV-type beta lactamases as the predominant ESBLs in many countries.
They originate from Kluyvera species and can be separated into 5 different groups: CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-8, and CTX-M-25.
CTX-M2, CTX-M3, and CTX-M14 are the most prevelant.
More than 80 CTX-M allotypes are currently known (2014).
The summed rest score (SRS), summed stress score (SSS) and summed difference score (SDS) are variables used to measure cardiac perfusion and ischemia on cardiac SPECT studies.
The SRS and SSS are calculated during the rest and stress parts of the study, respectively, and the SDS is the difference between the two.
A five-point scoring system is used to assign a perfusion value to each of the 17 or 20 myocardial segments (depending on which segmentation model is used), each of which corresponds to a coronary artery segment territory, as follows: 0 = normal tracer uptake; 1 = equivocal tracer uptake; 2 = moderate reduction in uptake; 3 = severe reduction of uptake; and 4 = absence of detectable tracer uptake.
The values for all of the segments are summed, giving a total possible SRS and SSS of 68 for the 17-segment model and 80 for the 20-segment model.
The sum of the differences between the score at rest and score with stress for each segment is the SDS, which represents the amount of ischemia.
The SRS, SSS and SDS can be converted to a percent of the total myocardium involved with stress, ischemic, or fixed defects by dividing the summed scores by either 68 or 80 (the maximum possible score for the 17 and 20-segment model, respectively), and multiplying by 100.
Strain is the magnitude of myocardial deformation, which is an energy-requiring process that occurs in both systole and diastole.
It is also considered a normalized, dimensionless measure of deformation of a segment of myocardium in response to an applied force or stress.
Abnormalities of myocardial deformation can be seen early in the development of mycardial pathophysiologic states, including ischemia.
Strain is a sensitive means for detecting regional myocardial dysfunction.
Strain calculations may be either Lagrangian (a deformation from its original length) or natural (a deformation relative to the length at a previous time).
The natural strain calculation is more appropriate than Lagrangian when large deformations are observed.
The direction of the greatest strain is considered the principal strain.
Strain values can either be positive, indicating lengthening, or negative, indicating shortening.
Values for normal circumferential and longitudinal strain are negative, and those for radial strain are positive.
Ara h 8 is a clinically relevant peanut allergen that has bears significant homology to the birch tree pollen allergen, Bet v 1.
Peanut allergy in a subgroup of patients with allergy to birch tree may be mediated by cross-reaction of Bet v 1 induced antibodies with the homologous peanut allergen Ara h 8.
Ara h 8 appears to have low stability to roasting and but resists gastric digestion, as do many/most food allergens.
Tiglylglycine is an acyl glycine.
Acyl glycines are normally minor metabolites of fatty acids.
However, the excretion of certain acyl glycines is increased in several inborn errors of metabolism.
In certain cases the measurement of these metabolites in body fluids can be used to diagnose disorders associated with mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.
Acyl glycines are produced through the action of glycine N-acyltransferase which is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction: acyl-CoA + glycine < -- > CoA + N-acylglycine Tiglylglycine is an intermediate product of the catabolism of isoleucine.
An elevated level of tiglylglycine is identified in urine of patients with beta-ketothiolase deficiency or with disorders of propionate metabolism .

When secreted from the gastric mucosa, it stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder and digestive enzymes from the pancreas.
The ABO blood group antigens are encoded by one genetic locus, the ABO locus, which has three alternative forms: A, B, and O. A child receives one of these three forms from each parent, yielding six possible genotypes and four possible blood types (aka phenotypes:
A, AB, B, O).
ABO blood group antigens remain of prime importance in transfusion and transplantation medicine, and they are the most immunogenic of all the blood group antigens.
ABO antibodies are of major clinical significance because they are naturally and universally occurring, and they are highly reactive.
The distribution of the four phenotypes varies across the world - type O is the most common, followed by type A, then type B, and type AB is the least common.
The ABO system is acknowledged in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, infectious and neoplastic disorders, and pre-eclampsia.
H antigen deficiency is known as the "Bombay phenotype" and is found in 1 in 10,000 people in India and 1 in 1 million people in Europe.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by the virus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus (MERS-CoV).
The illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, but was later found to have originated in Jordan in 2012.
MERS has been found in camels leading to speculation that they may be the initial reservoir for the virus.
The largest outbreak of MERS that has occurred outside of the Arabian Peninsula was in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and was linked to an individual who had been traveling in the Arabian Peninsula.
The virus is probably spread through respiratory secretions from infected individuals though the exact mode of transmission is under investigation.
Infection with MERS begins with an incubation period of 5-6 days followed by a severe acute illness that involves fever, shortness of breath and for patients with comorbidities or reduced immunity can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.
The mortality rate of MERS is 3-4 out of 10 people who are infected, though most of the people who die have underlying conditions.
In addition, some people experience only cold-like symptoms and others have no symptoms at all.
In the United States, most state laboratories are approved to test for MERS-CoV using the real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay developed by the CDC.
The assay can be run on respiratory, serum and stool specimens.
Von Willebrand collagen multimeric analysis is used to distinguish the subtype (1, 2 or 3) of von Willebrand disorders, not to establish the presence of the disorder.
It is used to determine the correct treatment in patients with the disease.
alpha-Amylase is an enzyme that hydrolyses alpha-bonds of large alpha-linked polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, yielding glucose and maltose.
It is the major form of amylase found in humans and other mammals It is also present in seeds containing starch as a food reserve, and is secreted by many fungi.
Increased plasma levels in humans are found in: Salivary trauma (including anaesthetic intubation) Mumps - due to inflammation of the salivary glands Pancreatitis - because of damage to the cells that produce amylase Renal failure - due to reduced excretion Total amylase readings of over 10X the upper limit of normal (ULN) are suggestive of pancreatitis.
Five to ten times the ULN may indicate ileus or duodenal disease or renal failure, and lower elevations are commonly found in salivary gland disease.
Implicit b-wave time is the amount of time between the flash onset and the peak of the b-wave produced on an electroretinogram (ERG).
The Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, is a well-known food fish belonging to the family Gadidae.

A 38-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein of the presynaptic vesicles in neuron and neuroendocrine cells.
It is expressed by a variety of normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine cells and is therefore used as an immunocytochemical marker for neuroendocrine differentiation in various tumors.
In ALZHEIMER DISEASE and other dementing disorders, there is an important synapse loss due in part to a decrease of synaptophysin in the presynaptic vesicles.
Cyclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan that causes disease in humans, and perhaps other primates.
It has been linked in the United States from fecally-contaminated imported raspberries and was virtually unknown before about 1990, but has been on the rise since.
The health risk associated with the disease is usually confined to adult foreigners visiting endemic regions and acquiring the infection: this is why C. cayetanensis has been labeled as causing "traveler's diarrhea.
This species was placed in the Cyclospora genus because of the spherical shape of its sporocysts
Frozen red cells are an excellent resource for patients with extremely rare blood types.
They are the preferred component for patients sensitized to immunoglobulin A (IgA).
They may also be indicated for patients sensitized to leukocyte and platelet antigen.
Threonine is a secondary marker for Citrullinemia type II.
4-Hydroxycoumarins are a class of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulant drug molecules derived from coumarin (chromen-2-one).
The primary mechanism of the 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs is the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase.
The synthetic drugs in the 4-hydroxycoumarin class are all noted primarily for their use as anticoagulants, though they can have several additional effects.
The simplest synthetic molecule in the 4-hydroxycoumarin class is warfarin, in which the aromatic 3-position substituent is a simple phenyl group.
So called "super-warfarins" or second-generation anticoagulants in this class, were developed as rodenticides for rodents that have developed warfarin resistance.
The second generation agents have even larger lipid-soluble substituents at the 3-position (e.g. brodifacoum), a chemical change that causes their half life in the body to be greatly increased (sometimes to months).
The antirodenticide chemicals are sometimes incorrectly referred to as "coumadins" rather than 4-hydroxycoumarins (Coumadin is a brandname for warfarin).
Antibodies against the 52-kd Ro(SS-A) protein are significantly associated with the primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).
Ethyl sulfate (EtS), also known as sulfovinic acid, is an ethanol metabolite and may be a biomarker for recent alcohol use.

Follitropin is a glycoprotein pituitary hormone, which is under complex regulation by hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and by gonadal sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone in females, and testosterone in males.
FSH acts on the granulosa cells of the ovary and the Sertoli cells of testis.
Normally FSH increase occurs at an early stage of puberty, 2-4 years before LH (Luteinizing Hormone) reaches the same levels.
Excessive FSH increase occurs at an early stage of puberty, 2-4 years before LH reaches the same levels.
Excessive FSH and LH are found in hypogonadism, anorchia, gonadal failure, complete testicular feminization syndrome, menopause, Klinefelter syndrome, alcoholism, and castration.
FSH and LH are pituitary products, and are useful to distinguish primary gonadal failure from secondary (hypothalamic/pituitary) causes of gonadal failure, menstrual disturbances and amenorrhea.
It is useful in defining menstrual cycle phases in infertility evaluation of women and testicular dysfunction in men.
Both FSH and LH are low in pituitary or hypothalamic failure.
FSH and LH are high following menopause.
Leptospira interrogans serovar Bulgarica is sporadically found in some areas of Queensland and New South Wales, and most cases are found in southern Queensland.
The main carrier is likely the rat, and probable sources of infection include contact with soil, water or other materials contaminated with the urine of an infected animal.
Bulgarica is one of the rarest leptospiral serovars found in Australia, with only occasional cases reported.
Glycine max native (nGlym) 5 is a vicilin-like protein of beta-Conglycinin.
The presence of nGly m 5 beta-conglycinin IgE antibodies (allergen code f431) indicates an allergy to soybeans.
The exposure route for Gly m 5 is ingestion.
Testing for IgE antibodies may be used to help diagnose an allergic disease or the cause of an anaphylactic episode in a patient.
The MED12 gene (mediator complex subunit 12) is located on chromosome Xq13.
The initiation of transcription is controlled in part by a large protein assembly known as the preinitiation complex.
A component of this preinitiation complex is a 1.2 MDa protein aggregate called Mediator.
This Mediator component binds with a CDK8 subcomplex which contains the protein encoded by this gene, mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), along with MED13, CDK8 kinase, and cyclin C.
The CDK8 subcomplex modulates Mediator-polymerase II interactions and thereby regulates transcription initiation and reinitation rates.
The MED12 protein is essential for activating CDK8 kinase.
Defects in this gene cause X-linked Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, also known as FG syndrome, and Lujan-Fryns syndrome.
Dieldrin is a light tan, flakey compound and an organochlorine insecticide.
It is toxic to ants, cutworms, armyworms, loopers, chiggars, chinch bugs, flea hoppers, crickets, diabrotica, drosophila, earwigs, wire worms, grasshoppers, flies, Japanese beetles, leaf miners, lygus, mosquitoes, wasps, roaches, slugs, snails, sowbugs, webworms, spittlebugs, termites, thrips, ticks and many more.
Dieldrin is dangerously toxic to birds, fish, beneficial insects, and honey bees.
It likely bioaccumulates in the food chain.
Dieldrin is extremely toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed by the skin and can lead to irritability, convulsions, coma, nausea, vomiting, headache, fainting, tremors, and eye irritation.
Dieldrin produces toxic fumes when heated and is a suspected carcinogen.
It is no longer manufactured in the United States.
The presence of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a pharmacologically-active metabolite of flunitrazepam and in vitro degradation product, is useful for confirmation of flunitrazepam ingestion.

Botulinum toxin is a protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, and is known to be highly neurotoxic.
Popularly known by one of its trade names, Botox, botulinum toxin is now commonly used for various cosmetic and medical procedures.
The NB gene (NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1) gene is located on chromosome 17q21.3.
This gene (NME1) was identified because of its reduced mRNA transcript levels in highly metastatic cells.
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) exists as a hexamer composed of 'A' (encoded by this gene) and 'B' (encoded by NME2) isoforms.
Mutations in this gene have been identified in aggressive neuroblastomas.
Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
Co-transcription of this gene and the neighboring downstream gene (NME2) generates naturally-occurring transcripts (NME1-NME2), which encodes a fusion protein comprised of sequence sharing identity with each individual gene product.
Dipyridamole is a drug that inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilation.
It inhibits the cellular reuptake of adenosine into platelets, red blood cells and endothelial cells leading to increased extracellular concentrations of adenosine.
It also inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase which normally breaks down adenosine into inosine.
This inhibition leads to further increased levels of extracellular adenosine.
Dipyridamole also inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase which normally breaks down cAMP.Adenosine interacts with the adenosine receptors to cause increased cAMP via adenylate cyclase.cAMP impairs platelet aggregation and also causes arteriolar smooth muscle relaxation.
Modified release dipyridamole is used in conjunction with aspirin (under the trade name Aggrenox Â®) in the secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack.
This practice is now confirmed by the ESPRIT trial.
Campesterol is a phytosterol, meaning it is a steroid derived from plants.
As a food additive, phytosterols have cholesterol-lowering properties (reducing cholesterol absorption in intestines), and may act in cancer prevention.
Phytosterols naturally occur in small amount in vegetable oils, especially soybean oil.
One such phytosterol complex, isolated from vegetable oil, is cholestatin, composed of campesterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol, and is marketed as a dietary supplement.
Sterols can reduce cholesterol in human subjects by up to 15%.
The mechanism behind phytosterols and the lowering of cholesterol occurs as follows : the incorporation of cholesterol into micelles in the gastrointestinal tract is inhibited, decreasing the overall amount of cholesterol absorbed.

Protoporphyrins are tetrapyrroles containing the following side chains:methyl (4)propionic acid (2)vinyl (2)In the metabolism of porphyrin, protoporphyrin IX is created by the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and the enzyme ferrochelatase converts it into heme.
Protoporphyrins are deposited in the shells of the eggs of some birds as a brown or red pigment, either as a ground color or as spotting.
This occurs in most passerine species, some ground-nesting non-passerines, such as waders, gulls, nightjars and sandgrouse, where it provides camouflage, and some parasitic cuckoos, which need to mimic their passerine hosts' eggs.
Protoporphyrins strengthen the egg shell, and are deposited where the shell is too thin as a result of calcium shortage.
Spotting therefore tend to be heavier where the local soil is calcium-deficient, and in the eggs laid last in a clutch.

Androstanediol is a metabolite of dihydrotestosterone, itself a metabolite of testosterone.
Androstanediol is implicated in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion.
As a metabolite of dihydroxytestosterone formed in the peripheral tissues, androstanediol and androstnediol-glucuronide can be used to estimate peripheral androgen activity.
Androstanediol is a potential GABA (A) receptor-modulating neurosteroid with anticonvulsant properties and hence could act as a key neuromodulator in the central nervous system.
It is considered that androstanediol has hedonic effects; therefore it is anticipated that androgens that are readily metabolized to androstanediol may have higher abuse potential than androgens that are not as easily metabolized to androstanediol.
These results add to the growing literature indicating that athletes and non-athletes may be at considerable risk when they abuse androgens., , .

Ticarcillin, almost invariably sold and used in combination with clavulanate as Timentin, is a beta-lactam antibiotic similar to penicillin.
It is often used as an injectable antibiotic for the treatment of gram negative bacteria, and is especially effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Its antibiotic properties arise from its ability to prevent cross-linking of peptidoglycan during cell wall synthesis when the bacteria tries to divide, causing death.
It will not treat viruses, including the flu.
Because it is similar in structure to penicillin, it should not be used by anyone with allergies to any penicillin-related antibiotic.
Many bacteria have developed a resistance to this antibiotic by producing beta-lactamase, which inactivates it.
Therefore, all modern ticarcillin includes clavulanic acid, an inbibitor of these enzymes.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is an anaerobic, flagellated parasitic protozoan that is among the most common non-viral sexually transmitted organisms whose only known host is humans.
It is estimated that 170 million new cases occur worldwide and it is the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States.
TV is known to increase HIV acquisition and transmission in both men and women by acting as a cofactor to increase susceptibility to HIV of an uninfected partner and infectivity of HIV of an infected partner.
In women, infection with TV is a possible risk factor for developing cervical neoplasia, post-operative infections, adverse pregnancy outcomes, atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.
In men, infection with TV can lead to non-gonococcal urethritis, infertility, chronic prostatitis and decreased sperm motility.
Diagnosis is most often made using wet mount microscopy which has a sensitivity of only 52%.
Other diagnostic methods include Pap smear, culture and PCR with sensitivities of 56%, 78% and 84%, respectively.

The projected heparin dose response test is a point-of-care test performed on fresh whole blood (no citrate added) to assess patient's individual response to heparin.
The test measures the baseline (no heparin) activated clotting time, and the activated clotting times on the same blood to which 2 different concentrations of unfractionated heparin is added.
From these measurements a projected dose response is calculated.
This test is used in the cardiac operating room where patients are anticoagulated with high (3 to 5 units heparin/mL of blood) levels of unfractionated heparin.
The effect of this level of heparin anticoagulation is measured every 20 to 30 minutes while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass.
The heparin dose response is used to determine the appropriate amount of heparin needed to increase the patient's activated clotting time to the target level used by the hospital.
The heparin dose response test is typically performed once at the beginning of the surgical procedure before the patient is placed on bypass.
Once the patient is heparinized and placed on bypass the activated clotting time and the heparin concentration (whole blood heparin assay) are determined in the operating room every 20 to 30 minutes during the procedure.
Heparin administered to patients in the cardiac OR is unfractionated, not low molecular weight.
The amount given greatly exceeds the amount that could be monitored by the APTT.
In this setting the most important concern is that the patient receive the appropriate amount in order to reach and maintain the required anticoagulant (thrombin inhibiting) protection.

Organisms producing CTX-M type ESBL enzymes have been isolated worldwide with more than 150 enzymes identified.
These enzymes have been classified into seven major phylogenetic groups: CTX-M -1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-25, CTX-M-74 and CTX-M-75.
The rare ESBL type CTX-M-8 has been isolated in Germany, mainly in E. coli, but also in Salmonella and E. aerogenes.
CTX-M type ESBL have been isolated worldwide and their incidence has increased dramatically and is still increasing leading to a major therapeutic issue.
Currently more than 150 allelic variants of CTX-M have been identified.
These enzymes are classified in five major phylogenetic groups based on their gene sequences: CTX-M -1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-25; two additional groups have been reported recently: CTX-M-74 and CTX-M-75.
The dissemination of these enzymes has caused an increased use of carbapenems for treatment of infections which carries its own risk of furthering resistance.
The genes are named with the prefix "bla", which stands for "beta-lactam", followed by the enzyme, for example, blaCTX-M-1.

Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) is a nucleotide analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen.
The replication of HCV requires NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, responsible for the synthesis of both positive-strand genomic RNA and negative-strand RNA.
Sofosbuvir mimics the natural substrate of NS5B polymerase and becomes incorporated into the growing RNA, inducing a chain termination event.
Sofosbuvir, as one of the nucleos(t)ide analog inhibitors, has a distinct resistance profile that does not overlap with the non-nucleoside NS5B protease inhibitors.
Resistance to sofosbuvir is uncommon.
The S282T mutation has been identified as the common variant to pose resistance to sofosbuvir, however, this variant is not generally found in untreated patients with HCV.
Myoglobin is a very sensitive marker (90-100%) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) but lacks specificity.
Serum concentrations of myoglobin increase above the reference interval as early as 1 hour after MI, with peak sensitivity in the range of 2-12 hr, suggesting that serum myoglobin reflects the early course of myocardial necrosis.
Myoglobin is rapidly cleared and thus has a substantially reduced clinical sensitivity after 12 hr.
For detecting AMI, myoglobin must be measured within the first 0-4 hr, the time period in which CK-MB and possibly cardiac troponin are still within their reference range.

Interferons (IFNs) are a class of natural proteins produced by the cells of the immune systems of most animals in response to challenges by foreign agents such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and tumor cells.
Interferons belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines.
IFNs belong to the large class of glycoproteins known as cytokines.
Interferons are named after their ability to "interfere" with viral replication within host cells.
IFNs have other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages; they increase recognition of infection or tumor cells by up-regulating antigen presentation to T lymphocytes; and they increase the ability of uninfected host cells to resist new infection by virus.
Certain host symptoms, such as aching muscles and fever, are related to the production of IFNs during infection.
About ten distinct IFNs have been identified in mammals; seven of these have been described for humans.
They are typically divided among three IFN classes: Type I IFN, Type II IFN, and Type III IFN.
IFNs belonging to all IFN classes are very important for fighting viral infections.
Phosphorus is a mineral that makes up one percent of a person's total body weight.
It is the second most abundant mineral in the body and present in every cell.
The main function of phosphorus is in the formation of bones and teeth, and it also plays an important role in how the body uses carbohydrates and fats.
Phosphorous is needed for the body to make protein for the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues, and also helps the body make ATP, a molecule the body uses to store energy.
The main food sources are meat and milk.
A diet that includes the right amounts of calcium and protein will also provide enough phosphorus.
Fruits and vegetables contain only small amounts of phosphorus.
In the body, almost all phosphorus is combined with oxygen, forming phosphate.
Sucrase is the name given to a number of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of sucrose to fructose and glucose.
The enzyme invertase, which occurs more commonly in plants, also hydrolyzes sucrose but by a different mechanism.
Sucrose intolerance (also known as Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency (CSID) or Sucrase-isomaltase deficiency) occurs when sucrase is not secreted in the small intestine.
With sucrose intolerance, the result of consuming sucrose is excess gas production and often diarrhea and malabsorption.
Lactose intolerance is a related disorder that reflects an individual's inability to hydrolyze the disaccharide lactose.
Sucrase is secreted by the tips of the villi of the epithelium in the small intestine.
Its levels are reduced in response to villi-blunting events such as celiac sprue and the inflammation associated with the disorder.
The levels increase in Pregnancy/Lactation and Diabetes as the villi hypertrophy.

It has also been called MÃ¼llerian inhibiting factor (MIF), MÃ¼llerian inhibiting hormone (MIH), and MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance (MIS).
It is named after Johannes Peter MÃ¼ller.
In men, inadequate embryonal AMH activity can lead to the Persistent MÃ¼llerian duct syndrome (PMDS), in which a rudimentary uterus is present and testes are usually undescended.
The AMH gene (AMH) or the gene (AMH-RII) for its receptor are usually abnormal.
AMH measurements have also become widely used in the evaluation of testicular presence and function in infants with intersex conditions, ambiguous genitalia, and cryptorchidism.

Cocaethylene is the ethyl ester of benzoylecgonine.
It is chemically related to cocaine, which is the corresponding methyl ester.
Cocaethylene is formed in the body when cocaine and alcohol have been taken simultaneously: the transesterification is catalysed by carboxylesterases in the liver.
Cocaethylene has similar euphoric properties to cocaine, but is longer lasting in the body.
Some studies suggest that it is more toxic than cocaine itself, particularly to the heart.
